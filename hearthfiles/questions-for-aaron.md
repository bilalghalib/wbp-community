# Questions for Aaron - Wellbeing Project Resource

## Decision-Forcing Questions

### 1. Integration Architecture
**Q:** How does this connect to Richard Davidson's assessment tool?  
**Why it matters:** Determines if we need org-level profiles, team connections, shared data structures.  
**Decision needed:** Are these separate systems or does one feed the other?

### 2. Resource vs Platform Spectrum
**Q:** On a scale of "simple directory" to "full community platform," where do you actually want to land?  
**Why it matters:** Determines features, maintenance burden, technical complexity.  
**Pushback:** You said "resource not platform" but some ideas (forums, AI chat) are platform-y. Which wins?

### 3. Launch Strategy
**Q:** Hearth Summit 2026 as launch vehicle? Or soft launch before?  
**Why it matters:** Informs timeline, what's MVP, whether we can pilot with one community first.  
**Opportunity:** Summit creates natural moment to "capture connections made here"

### 4. Ownership & Facilitation
**Q:** Who internally owns the ongoing rituals (yearly updates, seasonal pulses)?  
**Why it matters:** Tech is easy. Facilitation is hard. Without a champion, databases become graveyards.  
**Reality check:** This needs 5-10hrs/month of community stewardship to stay alive.

### 5. Privacy Model
**Q:** What's visible to who? Opt-in for everything or default-public within network?  
**Why it matters:** Affects trust, adoption, and legal considerations.  
**Example tensions:** "Ways of being" (growth edges) might be vulnerable - public or private?

## Validation Questions

### 6. Problem Severity
**Q:** How often do you field "who do you know who..." questions? Weekly? Daily?  
**Why it matters:** Validates if this is solving a real pain or a nice-to-have.

### 7. Hidden Assumptions
**Q:** When you imagine this working, who's using it? What percentage of network engages?  
**Reality check:** Most community directories have <30% complete profiles. What's success here?

### 8. Resource Constraint
**Q:** Budget range? DIY vs contractor vs platform solution?  
**Why it matters:** Determines if we're talking Airtable + Zapier or custom Next.js app.

## Provocations (Push Back)

### 9. The Null Hypothesis
**Q:** What if we don't build this? Could quarterly "who has X" emails to community leaders solve 80% of the problem for 5% of the effort?  
**Pushback:** Sometimes the answer is "don't build software."

### 10. The Real Job-to-Be-Done
**Q:** Is this about information access or about making the network *feel* more connected?  
**Why it matters:** If it's the latter, different solutions emerge (gatherings, stories, rituals vs databases).

## My Hunch (Bilal's Take)

The peer interview approach is the killer feature - it:
- Makes profile creation relational (not homework)
- Surfaces hidden gifts people don't know they have
- Creates micro-connections before directory lookup
- Builds ownership through participation

But it only works if framed as **optional gift-giving** not mandatory onboarding.

The danger: building too much too fast. Start with bare minimum - profiles with gifts/needs/ways-of-being, launch at Summit, see what people actually use before adding complexity.
