# Wellbeing Project Community Resource - Proposal

## The Real Problem (Beyond "Where's a therapist?")

You're not just answering resource questions - you're being a **human router** because:
- Network knowledge lives in people's heads, not systems
- Trust matters more than databases
- People don't know what they don't know (hidden gifts in the network)
- The community creates value through connection, but that value is invisible

## Core Approach: Resource, Not Platform

**Wrong framing:** "Build an app where people hang out"  
**Right framing:** "Create a living directory that grows through generosity"

### The Gift Exchange Model

People fill out profiles **not as homework** but as **gifts to each other**:
- Peer interviews (optional, self-selected)
- "What would you talk someone's head off about for an hour?"
- Track provenance: who introduced you, who gave you something valuable
- Make giving visible to reinforce community identity

## Three Phases (Practical Rollout)

### Phase 1: Hearth Directory (Now)
- Profile = yearly ritual, tied to login
- Core fields: gifts/offers, needs, ways of being (growth edges)
- Geography + "where I have experience/hookups"
- Photo + brief story (optional narrative)
- **Launch at Hearth Summit** - capture connections made in person

### Phase 2: Seasonal Pulse (3-6 months)
- Opt-in text message check-ins (quarterly)
- Microcheck-ins update profiles passively
- "How are you?" data over time = richer wellbeing picture than one-time assessments

### Phase 3: Emergence Layer (Future)
- AI triggers human connections (not replaces them)
- Pattern detection surfaces unexpected collaborations
- Member spotlights based on peer nominations

## Data We Actually Need

| Field | Why It Matters | Format |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| Gifts/Expertise | Reduce Aaron-as-router | Text + willingness for 30min call |
| Ways of Being | Growth edges, shared values | Constellation of 3-5 values |
| Geography + Networks | Physical proximity + knowledge zones | Location + "I know X well" |
| Provenance | Who introduced you | Name + brief story |
| Org Connection | For assessment tool integration | Invite colleagues feature |
| Change History | Wellbeing journeys over time | Version tracking (annual) |

## Critical Questions for Aaron

1. **What's the relationship between this and the assessment tool Richard Davidson is building?** Does that dictate any data structure?

2. **Platform vs Resource spectrum:** Where do you actually want to land? (I'm pushing hard toward resource because maintenance burden)

3. **Who champions this internally?** One-time build vs ongoing facilitation - who owns the ritual?

4. **Launch vehicle:** Hearth Summit 2026? Or soft launch before?

5. **Privacy boundaries:** Opt-in for everything? Who sees what?

## Why This Could Actually Work

- **Framing shift:** Not "fill out your profile" but "help us see your gifts"
- **Tied to existing rhythm:** Yearly login = yearly reflection
- **Lightweight maintenance:** Seasonal pulses are async, low-overhead
- **Peer-driven:** Interviews surface hidden value, build relationships
- **Values-aligned:** Generosity, emergence, reverence for growth

## What Makes This Different

Most community databases fail because they're **extractive chores**. This succeeds if it's a **generative ritual** - people update because:
- It helps someone find them for something meaningful
- It's a moment of reflection on growth
- It makes the invisible network visible
- It reduces "who do you know who..." messages Aaron gets
