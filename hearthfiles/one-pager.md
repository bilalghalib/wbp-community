# Wellbeing Project Resource - One-Pager

## What We're Solving
You're the human router for the network. "Where's a therapist? Who knows X? Who can help with Y?" This extracts your time and keeps network knowledge invisible.

## The Shift
**From:** Database people grudgingly fill out  
**To:** Gift exchange that surfaces hidden value in the network

## How It Works

### 1. Yearly Ritual (Tied to Login)
Profile update = moment of reflection, not homework  
- What I'd talk your head off about for an hour
- Ways of being I'm growing into  
- Where I am + where I have experience/hookups
- Who introduced me + what gift they gave me

### 2. Optional Peer Interviews
People interview each other, surface gifts they don't know they have  
Creates connection + richer profiles than self-assessment

### 3. Seasonal Pulses (Later)
Opt-in text check-ins (quarterly)  
"How are you?" over time = richer wellbeing data than one snapshot

## What Makes This Work
- **Framing:** Gift-giving, not data entry
- **Timing:** Launch at Hearth Summit - capture in-person connections
- **Light touch:** Resource, not platform - people come when they need something
- **Provenance:** Track who introduced who, what connections mattered

## MVP (8 weeks, ~$5k)
Next.js + Supabase + clean UX  
Core features only:
- Auth + profile form
- Directory (searchable/filterable)
- Admin panel for you

Skip for now: peer interviews (manual), seasonal pulses (email), AI, complexity

## Your Decisions Today
1. Launch at Hearth Summit 2026? (gives us time, natural venue)
2. How does this connect to Richard's assessment tool?
3. Who owns ongoing facilitation? (5-10hrs/month community work)
4. Budget: DIY Airtable (~$500) or custom build (~$5k)?
5. Privacy model: opt-in or default visible within network?

## Why This Could Fail
- No internal champion for rituals (tech is easy, facilitation is hard)
- Built too much too fast (bloat kills adoption)
- Platform creep (forums, chat, etc) - maintain discipline on "resource not platform"
- Framed as homework not gift

## Why This Could Succeed
- Peer interviews = killer feature (relational, surfaces hidden gifts)
- Tied to existing rhythm (yearly login)
- Values-aligned (generosity, emergence, growth)
- Solves your real problem (reduces router burden)

## Next Steps
1. Decide: Are we doing this?
2. If yes: Timeline (Summit launch?) + Budget
3. Start small: Test peer interview process manually with 10 people
4. I'll draft user stories + wireframes (1 week)

**Bottom line:** This works if it's a generous ritual, not a database. The peer interview approach is novel enough to be interesting, practical enough to scale.
