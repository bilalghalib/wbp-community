# First-Time User Experience & Community Ideas

**Date:** January 14, 2026
**Purpose:** Address "what do we show people who have never entered the platform?" and identify community-building opportunities from all conversations

---

## The Core Problem

When someone logs in for the first time, we can't show:
- "47 people viewed your practitioners" (they have none)
- "Your contributions rippled through the network" (they haven't contributed)
- Stats that only exist after engagement

**But we CAN show connection to something bigger.**

---

## Ideas from the Conversations

### From Jan 9 Call with Ale

| Quote | Design Implication |
|-------|-------------------|
| "I want them to see a really awesome thing that is full of really cool content" | The reveal should feel substantial, not empty |
| "Won't reveal survey summary until 75% complete" | **Collective threshold** - you're part of unlocking something |
| "Feeling alone and being the first one" | Anti-loneliness design - show you're joining others |
| "Connecting people with each other" | Breadcrumbs to others, even without direct messaging |
| "Your contributions" section | Personal contribution tracking matters |

### From Aaron's Call

| Quote | Design Implication |
|-------|-------------------|
| "Springboard - you come there so you can spring off" | Frame as launchpad, not destination |
| "Price of entry into the network" | Contribution = membership |
| "People that sometimes don't want people to know they're tuning in" | Respect for privacy, gentle community |
| "Build up a reservoir" | Collective resource building |

### From WhatsApp Community (WHEN Network)

| Observation | Design Implication |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Shantideva poem sharing on New Year's | Community values poetry, reflection, meaning |
| "Missing all the pretty people... love you all" | Warmth and affection is the norm |
| Spotlight sessions, newsletters, gatherings | Regular rhythm of connection |
| People sharing links to each other's work | Mutual support culture |
| "Your presence during the last spotlight session" | Showing up matters |

## Recommended Approach

**Combination of A + D:**

1. **Welcome screen** - Show what exists (Gift First)
2. **Community quote** - Real voice from the network (Invitation)
3. **Begin survey** - Simple, warm call to action

## For Returning Users (With Stats)

When we DO have engagement data, show it warmly:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                 │
│  Welcome back                                                   │
│                                                                 │
│  Since your last visit:                                        │
│                                                                 │
│  A few people found their way to practitioners you shared.      │
│  Someone in East Africa downloaded your toolkit.                │
│  The community has grown by 12 organizations.                   │
│                                                                 │
│  Ready to refresh your contribution for 2026?                  │
│                                                                 │
│  [ Update & Continue ]                                          │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key differences:**
- "A few people" not "47 people" (warmer, less gamified)
- Sentence-based, not stat-cards
- Geographic specificity adds texture
- No sparkles, emojis, or fire metaphors

## What NOT to Do

| Avoid | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Big stat numbers (47, 89) | Feels gamified, "tech bro" |
| Fire/spark/hearth overload | Can feel performative |
| Badges, points, streaks | Gamification doesn't fit the culture |
| "Add My Spark" | Too cute, not serious enough |
| Heavy progress bars | Adds pressure |
| Competitive framing | This is collaborative, not competitive |

---

## Implementation Priority

| Feature | Effort | Impact | Phase |
|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| First-time welcome screen | Low | High | Phase 2 |
| Returning user welcome | Low | High | Phase 2 |
| My Contributions page | Medium | High | Phase 2 |
| Threshold unlock logic | Medium | High | Phase 3 |
| Regional map visualization | High | Medium | Phase 3 |
| Community quotes rotation | Low | Medium | Phase 3 |

---

## Summary

The key insight: **this community operates on warmth, presence, and collective meaning** - not gamification, stats, or individual achievement.

First-time users should feel:
- **Welcomed** into something that already exists
- **Meaningful** - their contribution matters to the whole
- **Safe** - they're not exposed or competitive
- **Connected** - even without direct messaging

The "magic moment" isn't about big numbers - it's about belonging.
