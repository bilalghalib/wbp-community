### Personal Updates
- Bilal’s family is sick; Suleiman has a stomach flu; Bilal is recovering while trying not to pass illness to Joe.
- Joe is pregnant with morning sickness; extended family nearby for support; Wi‑Fi issues prompted tethering and moving locations.
- Travel updates: Egypt trip with wife’s family; London meeting with a teacher; Egypt visit later with the new baby; learning about a second child during travel.
- Holidays and family time: Christmas/Posadas in Monterrey with multiple gatherings; New Orleans trip for New Year with parents and siblings.
- General mood: productive uplift from working text/code, despite illness and connectivity problems.

### Security, Privacy, and Data Governance
- Early concern about security; brief security audit completed.
- Decision leaning toward not storing personal user data; prefer aggregated regional data to reduce liability.
- Discussion of data retention, anonymization, and who accesses data; GDPR/server location considerations; strong encryption and two‑factor authentication discussed.
- Concept of “white glove” human support raised to improve user experience and security.
- Debate about how to handle logs, surveys, and insights (free text vs structured data) to minimize risk while capturing value.

### Platform Vision and Data Intelligence
- Proposal of a data intelligence hub to capture regional insights from lived experience.
- Annual member survey planned to update resources and practitioners; potential year‑to‑year insights for regional needs.
- Onboarding gating idea: access to platform after a yearly update, plus separate surveys for deeper analytics.
- Need to balance individual vs organizational data: aggregate at region/sector when necessary.
- Consideration of whether to map regions and sectors; branding and taxonomy decisions in progress.

### Surveys, Onboarding, and Data Workflow
- Onboarding survey planned to seed platform use; annual survey to drive ongoing insights.
- Debates about whether surveys should be long-form or structured; preference for structured data with open input (cred taxonomy) to manage ambiguity.
- Discussion of closing dates for surveys to enable timely analytics and communications.
- Questions about how surveys link to practitioner/resource uploads; potential for integrated attachments and easy contribution workflows.
- Idea to use an adaptive taxonomy to classify insights and add new categories as needed.

### Team Roles, Phases, and Budget
- Coordinator role (junior) identified; expected to join February to support outreach, scheduling, and community engagement.
- A senior product owner/lead is needed to own the platform long‑term; current plan contemplates phased growth of the team.
- Phase plan: Phase 1 – platform build and internal testing; Phase 2 – testing with 30 participants; Phase 3 – scaled soft launch with repeated batches of 30; ongoing assessment into Phase 4+.
- Budget sketch ( provisional): Phase 1 around 2000; Phase 2 around 1500; Phase 3 around 2500; total around 6000 by week 13; exact figures to be confirmed.
- Handover and ongoing support discussed; decision on contractor vs in‑house team and whether a future contract will follow Phase 3.

### Branding, Governance, and Technical Considerations
- Branding discussions include Hearth branding alignment and Wellbeing Project branding; ongoing branding decision with leadership.
- Legal and data‑privacy leads to review data export (CSV) and analytics needs; admin access controls and who can extract data.
- Taxonomies for practitioners and organizations discussed; alignment with existing Wellbeing Project taxonomies to support onboarding and analytics.
- Considerations about a feature request channel vs internal focus groups; current plan leans toward feedback gathered through focus groups and coordinated surveys.
- Technical scope: discussion of potential larger dev team in the future; current stack deemed solid for prototyping; questions about hosting location and data residency.

### Next Steps and Scheduling
- Agree to weekly check‑ins; proposed time around 3:30 PM local time; calendar invites to be sent.
- Plan to run a five‑person onboarding and survey design sprint next week; create sample data sets for testing.
- Prepare and share a Google Doc or spreadsheet with sample survey fields and drop‑downs; align on taxonomy and brand assets.
- Schedule a kickoff for the onboarding survey content and finalize the first‑phase deliverables; confirm who will contribute content and who will review.
- Follow up on branding decisions, governance roles, and the final scope of the first release.

Content: 02:58 Speaker A: That's great.
02:59 Speaker A: Having a little bit of money coming in.
03:01 Speaker A: It'll be great.
03:38 Speaker A: Hello?

03:44 Speaker B: Do you hear me?
03:49 Speaker A: Can you not hear me?
03:51 Speaker A: Hello?
03:52 Speaker B: Hi.
03:53 Speaker A: Yeah.
03:54 Speaker B: Yes.
03:54 Speaker A: Might be a little messy.
03:56 Speaker A: Just.
03:56 Speaker A: I have a flu.
03:58 Speaker A: There's a pandemic.
03:58 Speaker A: I don't know if you heard, in France.
04:00 Speaker A: Epidemic, actually.
04:04 Speaker B: I didn't know.
04:05 Speaker B: Bilal, would you rather remove this?
04:07 Speaker A: Like, you know, I was looking at the timeline.
04:10 Speaker A: I was like, oh, it's January.
04:14 Speaker B: But that can be moved to, like, that one was made in December and we didn't run March.
04:21 Speaker A: I know that there's the thing happening in March, and we want to align with other things.
04:24 Speaker A: And.
04:25 Speaker A: And for me, I just want to start moving.
04:27 Speaker A: It'll.
04:27 Speaker A: It'll be helpful to just.
04:30 Speaker A: We don't have to take too.
04:32 Speaker A: Too long.
04:32 Speaker A: It was.
04:33 Speaker A: It was great to put some of these things together in text and also for me to get back into the code.
04:39 Speaker A: I just reviewed the code again.
04:40 Speaker A: I added an FAQ page, like you mentioned, for the, you know, like, we don't know all of these facilitators, so your mileage may vary kind of thing.
04:50 Speaker A: And it was.
04:51 Speaker A: It's been good.
04:52 Speaker A: It's been good to have something to get my mind off of the.
04:58 Speaker A: The flu, you know, But I may tether just because the WI fi is not so good.
05:08 Speaker A: Where is my phone?
05:13 Speaker A: One second.
05:14 Speaker A: I'll move somewhere where the WI fi is better.
05:37 Speaker A: I'm just tethering because my computer is.
05:40 Speaker B: I'm going to try to move to another.
05:42 Speaker A: Yeah, you too.
05:43 Speaker A: Trying to get better.
05:44 Speaker A: Internet as well.
05:47 Speaker A: Let's see.
05:48 Speaker A: Hopefully this works.
05:50 Speaker A: Okay.
05:53 Speaker A: The real tough part is baby Suleiman is also sick.
05:57 Speaker A: Everyone's sick, so.
06:00 Speaker B: All right.
06:00 Speaker A: Yeah, it's.
06:03 Speaker B: He has Bilal.
06:04 Speaker B: Hi.
06:05 Speaker B: We got cut off for like a minute.
06:09 Speaker A: Yeah, I just put the.
06:12 Speaker A: I just started tethering.
06:14 Speaker A: Hopefully the WI fi is better for my phone.
06:17 Speaker A: Is this any better?
06:20 Speaker B: I moved also to another spot.
06:22 Speaker B: I think it's better.
06:23 Speaker A: That's great.
06:26 Speaker A: Yeah.
06:26 Speaker A: So the baby, I think, started it.
06:29 Speaker A: He.
06:29 Speaker A: He got a stomach flu, and so he's having a tough time, and then he gave it to me, and I'm trying not to give it to Joe.
06:36 Speaker A: You've heard of these things, right?
06:37 Speaker A: Like families.
06:38 Speaker A: It's like when somebody gets it.
06:44 Speaker B: I'm sorry.
06:46 Speaker A: It's good.
06:46 Speaker A: It's good to do something other than sleep.
06:51 Speaker B: And how your holiday.
06:55 Speaker B: How was Egypt?
06:56 Speaker B: When did you get mad?
06:58 Speaker A: Yeah, so it was, you know, my.
07:01 Speaker A: My wife's parents, her dad has ms, and so he's in a wheelchair.
07:06 Speaker A: And so like being in Turkey, it was a big trip.
07:08 Speaker A: It was her parents and my parents really meeting, spending quality time together.
07:13 Speaker A: There was a lot of affection shown which has never really happened before.
07:16 Speaker A: So I'm really glad for that.
07:19 Speaker A: And then in, in Egypt it was okay.
07:25 Speaker A: I'm not sure.
07:27 Speaker A: Yeah.
07:29 Speaker A: What.
07:30 Speaker A: Yeah.
07:30 Speaker A: So Egypt was great.
07:32 Speaker A: The.
07:32 Speaker A: Okay, you know, I'll just tell you like we're expecting a second.
07:35 Speaker A: I don't know if I told you already.
07:37 Speaker A: Did I tell you?
07:38 Speaker A: Okay.
07:38 Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
07:39 Speaker A: It's supposed to be congratulations, you know, keep it on the DL.
07:44 Speaker A: But in, in Egypt.
07:46 Speaker A: Yeah, it was really great.
07:47 Speaker A: The first time we, you know, started to realize baby Suleiman was on his way.
07:53 Speaker A: We saw my sheikh, my teacher in, in London, I think.
07:58 Speaker A: And so now it was really nice to have him meet Josephine and meet the new baby.
08:04 Speaker A: So yeah.
08:04 Speaker A: How did you spend your.
08:07 Speaker B: Wow.
08:08 Speaker A: Christmas, New Year's time?
08:11 Speaker B: Yes.
08:12 Speaker B: Congratulations first of all and thank you for sharing that with me.
08:15 Speaker A: Going to be.
08:17 Speaker B: And about your teacher too, that you saw him in London and now in Egypt with this news like wow.
08:21 Speaker A: Every time Joe's pregnant, she meets him and we didn't know we were the tickets.
08:27 Speaker A: We had no idea.
08:28 Speaker A: And you know, we learned three days before traveling and we were thinking, should we stop?
08:32 Speaker A: Should we not leave?
08:34 Speaker A: Yeah.
08:34 Speaker A: And so, so I, I'm.
08:35 Speaker A: I got the flu.
08:37 Speaker A: Joe has.
08:37 Speaker A: What is that called?
08:38 Speaker A: Nausea, you know, pregnancy nausea.
08:40 Speaker A: Like morning sickness and baby has a stomach, stomach bug.
08:44 Speaker A: So.
08:44 Speaker A: Everyone.
08:46 Speaker B: Hi.
08:47 Speaker A: Thankfully we have Joe's parents close by and so we came here for some help.
08:52 Speaker A: Yeah.
08:53 Speaker A: How about you?
08:54 Speaker A: How was your New Year's?
08:56 Speaker A: How's.
08:56 Speaker A: How's Mexico?
08:57 Speaker A: Like, what do they do during New Year's?
08:59 Speaker A: Like you're in Mexico, right?
09:01 Speaker A: Mexico City.
09:02 Speaker B: Yes, yes, I'm.
09:04 Speaker B: I'm in.
09:04 Speaker B: I live in Mexico City.
09:05 Speaker B: I'm back now.
09:06 Speaker B: I came back Monday, but I was one month in my parents house in Monterrey in the north of Mexico.
09:17 Speaker B: In.
09:18 Speaker B: No, that was.
09:20 Speaker A: So Monterey is the other university though.
09:23 Speaker A: There's a university there?
09:24 Speaker B: Yes, it's the university they started in that city and they're called.
09:29 Speaker B: But they're like 50 campuses or something like that.
09:35 Speaker B: Yes.
09:37 Speaker B: And Christmas, well, for Catholics it's like my family's Catholic.
09:43 Speaker B: You have.
09:44 Speaker B: We call it Posadas, which is like Christmas dinners or lunches with friends, family, but a lot of them.
09:52 Speaker B: And it was like.
09:55 Speaker B: Yes, I don't know how many I went to, but it's very nice because it's like closing the year together and the food delicious.
10:02 Speaker A: And people like.
10:03 Speaker B: There's also a series.
10:05 Speaker A: It's like, like, okay, first the grandparents get the, the main invite, and then the cousin.
10:10 Speaker A: This cousin.
10:10 Speaker A: Because they chose it first.
10:12 Speaker A: Like, how do you pick all of the.
10:15 Speaker B: Yeah, the different lunches, the people who go no.
10:18 Speaker B: Or what?
10:19 Speaker A: Different lunches.
10:22 Speaker B: It's usually like, it varies by region in Mexico, but in Monterrey, it's really popular to have like turkey, pasta, potato, mashed potato, like, sort.
10:37 Speaker B: I don't know if that's like, American influence.
10:39 Speaker A: Like, it doesn't sound really South American or Hispanic.
10:44 Speaker B: Yeah.
10:45 Speaker B: Yes.
10:47 Speaker B: Yeah.
10:48 Speaker B: But there.
10:48 Speaker B: That was that.
10:49 Speaker B: And then my family and I.
10:51 Speaker B: So I have a brother and a sister, and my brother lives in Monterrey with his wife and their kid.
10:58 Speaker B: And my sister traveled also to Monterrey with her husband.
11:02 Speaker B: And all of us, with my parents, traveled to New Orleans to spend New Year's.
11:09 Speaker A: It's not too far, right.
11:11 Speaker A: The distance to New Orleans, sort of.
11:14 Speaker B: It was a road trip that we made in several days.
11:17 Speaker B: So we went to.
11:19 Speaker B: Yeah.
11:21 Speaker A: Through the borders.
11:22 Speaker B: If you do it one way, it's like four.
11:26 Speaker A: What, Move into America.
11:27 Speaker A: I can't believe it.
11:29 Speaker B: But that's, that's super.
11:33 Speaker B: Like, it's, it's very common for people to drive across the border.
11:37 Speaker B: When you live in the northern part of Mexico, Monterey is two hours from the border.
11:41 Speaker B: Driving.
11:43 Speaker A: Yeah.
11:44 Speaker A: I don't know.
11:44 Speaker A: America, just the news that I see from America and the border issues.
11:48 Speaker A: I know, you know, I'm afraid to go even in the airplane.
11:52 Speaker A: Like, I delete my WhatsApp.
11:53 Speaker A: I. I make sure to try to clean my digital, which maybe can connect to some of the security ideas that we're going to be talking about today.
12:02 Speaker A: We're living in a.
12:04 Speaker A: You know, in the beginning, when Aaron started talking about the importance of security and we were just discussing it together, I was like, that seems a little extreme.
12:12 Speaker A: And then when I just see what's happening, I'm like, oh, no, it's.
12:16 Speaker A: Yeah, it's.
12:17 Speaker A: It's good.
12:18 Speaker A: It's.
12:18 Speaker A: It's the smart thing to do.
12:19 Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
12:24 Speaker A: So I did a really brief security audit as well.
12:29 Speaker A: Let me see here.
12:33 Speaker A: Yeah.
12:33 Speaker B: What did you think of the documents?
12:38 Speaker B: So, like, the, the timeline, the budget.
12:42 Speaker B: We have not talked about that.
12:43 Speaker A: Yeah, the.
12:45 Speaker A: So some of the, the, the questions were, it looks like you want a team, but there was a confusion about when that team would join because there was, like, a lot of red, like, to be seen.
12:56 Speaker A: And I'm wondering, is that budget for me and the team or is that budget just for me?
13:01 Speaker B: What's that's budget just for you.
13:06 Speaker B: The development of the platform, the server costs maintenance.
13:12 Speaker A: Okay, but, but is there also this idea of having.
13:14 Speaker A: Because let me look at the doc, there were a few people, I was like this is exciting.
13:17 Speaker A: I won't be alone.
13:18 Speaker A: You know, like there was the idea of well, the coordinator, the legal team, at least in the early phases.
13:27 Speaker A: And then in phase three, there's the product owner as well.
13:31 Speaker A: And do you, did you think about who that would be also in.
13:36 Speaker A: In phase two?
13:37 Speaker A: So pretty, pretty soon there's this hope that there will be a product owner which would be great to clarify that like who it is and.
13:56 Speaker B: The university network.
13:57 Speaker B: I help with the regional.
13:58 Speaker B: All of the regional summits happening in the Americas and the regional strategy.
14:04 Speaker B: I cannot do this on my own.
14:05 Speaker B: And this project needs a person that can fully own it.
14:09 Speaker B: No, so that's what I'm aiming for.
14:14 Speaker A: Some important decisions to make.
14:15 Speaker A: Because you added some questions around like liability and what does it mean to be like a facilitator versus an owner.
14:22 Speaker A: And then when you're hiring someone like me, am I a part of the well being like project team or not and how does that affect liability?
14:28 Speaker A: There's like a lot of questions.
14:30 Speaker A: Know that it opens up that someone needs to be.
14:34 Speaker A: Yeah.
14:34 Speaker A: To, to be able to think through all of the different pieces.
14:40 Speaker B: And for operating the platform, like who's going to be the point of contact for the users?
14:46 Speaker B: No, there's going to be a lot of questions holding that community of users making sure the information on the platform is correct and updated.
14:54 Speaker A: That was one of the questions I had you mentioned this idea of.
15:01 Speaker A: Support and you know there are, you've seen many websites.
15:05 Speaker A: There's like click here for support and there's like a page and you can search the support page or are you just thinking of it like an email address and like this is the person you email for support.
15:14 Speaker A: Should there be a contact form, for instance, you know, for the support element.
15:24 Speaker B: See, I think in the beginning, like in this pilot phase, these first months, I imagine it as having those guides, the how to guides, the frequently asked questions.
15:36 Speaker B: And since it's going to be very closely held at night, me and the potential coordinator, we're going to start with a coordinator that will help me with the messages to the community, scheduling the focus groups and the testings and that.
15:52 Speaker B: So I think people will directly contact us.
15:57 Speaker A: Oh, nice.
15:57 Speaker A: Thank you dear.
15:59 Speaker A: I like strong.
16:02 Speaker A: My wife is nice.
16:05 Speaker B: Oh, that's strong.
16:11 Speaker A: Wow.
16:12 Speaker A: Okay.
16:12 Speaker B: That's like opened up eyes are burning your airway.
16:19 Speaker A: Yeah.
16:19 Speaker A: And that's, that's pretty exciting to have this, this like contact person coordinator.
16:25 Speaker A: And it's gonna be super important.
16:26 Speaker A: Have you heard of this idea of like white glove software?
16:31 Speaker A: A lot of software, like before it's fully developed, it just has like pages and then real human beings in the middle.
16:37 Speaker A: You know, you send an email and somebody's like, okay, let me just do all the work and then like connect you to this and you know, and then give you the next link.
16:45 Speaker A: And it's a way of really knowing what people want and how, how to be smooth, you know, like if, if things are just not working but there's nobody there to be able to offer a way to.
17:04 Speaker A: And this kind of makes me wonder if there should be some sort of like emergency override situation systems for the facilitator, like, oh, if something breaks, they should be able to like reset things or, or something like that.
17:19 Speaker A: Yeah.
17:20 Speaker A: How do you envision the first onboarding?
17:23 Speaker A: Because, because I'm, I'm, I'm excited about that and I want to make sure that one of the ideas I had was we take that table, that chart, and then we put like, what has to happen when and what are the features that are like abs, like absolute bare minimum.
17:38 Speaker A: And one of them is coming up with the survey.
17:40 Speaker A: Right?
17:41 Speaker A: Like what?
17:42 Speaker A: Because that's like, I think one of the, the gaps, there's the facilitator list, there's the PDF and research up late uploading thing.
17:51 Speaker A: But the surveys is designed currently in a way that we don't want.
17:58 Speaker A: Right.
17:59 Speaker A: Like the first way of designing it was like anybody can make a survey and then you can host it and you can share it.
18:04 Speaker A: But we have a very different idea for how surveys should work.
18:06 Speaker A: Right?
18:09 Speaker B: Yes.
18:13 Speaker B: Then I, I still don't know which survey we're going to use.
18:19 Speaker B: Like in this testing, I don't know yet.
18:28 Speaker A: Do you want like, you know, there's the phase zero.
18:30 Speaker A: I feel like the phase zero should be like I pick one of the surveys that I use like the values and action character profile or something like that.
18:43 Speaker A: And just so, because there's a lot of the questions around the security and the, you know, we're not keeping data on people.
18:56 Speaker A: Right.
18:56 Speaker A: We want to keep data on organizations and we want individuals to be able to submit to an organization.
19:02 Speaker A: And so some of the questions are around how long should we preserve individual responses.
19:09 Speaker A: And the easiest, least liability thing is never.
19:13 Speaker A: We just take it, we digest it and we make the summary and then we don't have to ever Worry about it.
19:17 Speaker A: Like, even if somebody hacks our systems, we're like, okay, well, you just have aggregate data.
19:22 Speaker A: Very.
19:23 Speaker A: It's not as bad.
19:23 Speaker A: Just, like, not much that can be exposed there.
19:30 Speaker A: But how do we decide that?
19:35 Speaker A: You know?
19:36 Speaker A: And so I wanted to make an assessment and to go through, because then we'll find all the questions, you know, inside there.
19:43 Speaker A: Like, okay, well, here's the aggregate page.
19:45 Speaker A: Should I save it or not, etc.
19:47 Speaker A: So.
19:50 Speaker B: Mm.
19:54 Speaker B: Would you like us to go, like, through the document to see the comments that you left on it, or would you like to, like, how should we do this?
20:06 Speaker A: Yeah, I think, like, the.
20:08 Speaker A: The thing that I would like by the end is to have the phases and deliverables be filled.
20:14 Speaker A: You know, those, like, boxes over here.
20:17 Speaker A: If we put content in there in the end, that will make me feel like, oh, okay, we have a plan, you know, but we can.
20:26 Speaker A: To do that.
20:27 Speaker A: I think we can go through the document initially.
20:29 Speaker A: Should we go through the security document?
20:33 Speaker A: Because that one seems like mostly a list of concerns and questions rather than answers.
20:40 Speaker A: How do we.
20:40 Speaker B: Yeah, I. Aaron asked me to create that document after we had our conversation in November with.
20:47 Speaker B: With you.
20:49 Speaker B: And that's like, that's what I generated, but I think it's more to the.
20:56 Speaker B: Just, like, have documented what we've been chatting about, what we want to be careful of, and what we.
21:10 Speaker A: Okay.
21:11 Speaker A: Yeah.
21:11 Speaker A: So let's go through the first document first.
21:15 Speaker A: You want to share the screen, maybe, or how do you want to go about it?
21:21 Speaker B: Yes.
21:22 Speaker A: Yeah, let's.
21:24 Speaker B: Do you want the confidentiality one?
21:27 Speaker B: Wait.
21:30 Speaker B: Yes, I'm seeing your screen.
21:32 Speaker A: Bueno.
21:33 Speaker A: Here we go.
21:35 Speaker A: Okay, so this is the core objectives.
21:43 Speaker B: I explained it a bit in the email I sent to you in December.
21:49 Speaker B: This section.
21:55 Speaker A: Are you frozen?
21:58 Speaker B: No, sorry, I was seeing that you were reading the other parts, right?
22:01 Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, go ahead.
22:02 Speaker A: You.
22:02 Speaker A: You can.
22:03 Speaker A: Do you want to.
22:03 Speaker A: You want to drive?
22:11 Speaker A: Oh, oh, no.
22:14 Speaker A: My wi fi.
22:32 Speaker A: Okay, hopefully I'm back, I think.
22:52 Speaker A: Are we back?
22:56 Speaker B: Yes.
22:56 Speaker B: I think the screen sharing is not allowing us, like, to really hear each other.
23:01 Speaker A: Maybe you can try.
23:01 Speaker A: Maybe your Internet is stronger.
23:03 Speaker A: If you want to try screen sharing.
23:05 Speaker A: You can drive and I can watch.
23:09 Speaker A: Okay, let's see.
23:13 Speaker B: Oh, here.
23:15 Speaker B: Share my screen.
23:28 Speaker B: Correctly.
23:28 Speaker B: There.
23:28 Speaker A: Yeah, it's loading.
23:52 Speaker A: Strange.
24:04 Speaker A: Can you hear me?
24:09 Speaker B: Do you hear me?
24:10 Speaker B: I. I do.
24:14 Speaker A: Maybe.
24:15 Speaker B: Maybe until you see my screen, I'm.
24:18 Speaker A: Gonna go sense video until I figure out what's going on.
24:22 Speaker B: Okay.
24:23 Speaker A: So, yeah, I'm here.
24:24 Speaker A: I can hear you.
24:24 Speaker A: I see the screen.
24:25 Speaker B: Okay.
24:25 Speaker B: I could do that too.
24:27 Speaker A: The text is more important right now.
24:29 Speaker A: Yeah.
24:32 Speaker B: Okay, so the project overview, we already had this developed before.
24:38 Speaker B: It was about the resources connecting with facilitators, surveys and then this one.
24:47 Speaker B: Generating a collective intelligence from lived experience is a new thing Aaron and I were chatting about.
24:55 Speaker B: So it's having this space on the platform that we're calling a data intelligence hub, where we can capture insights from what people are experiencing in their region.
25:08 Speaker B: Once a year we plan to send a member only survey, as you can read here, where people will update new resources they want to update, upload or new practitioners, like once a year update of the platform.
25:24 Speaker B: And in this reminder to update, we also want to ask questions to understand their perceptions of the field and of their region.
25:35 Speaker A: Yeah, so this is, this is where it gets a little tricky.
25:39 Speaker A: But I think because we were saying we don't want to save individual user data, but if it's a regional process, maybe we aggregate things into a, a region rather than an organization.
25:55 Speaker A: You know, because it kind of, it gets a little blurry between individual well being and organizational well being with this survey.
26:05 Speaker B: Yes, this one.
26:07 Speaker B: And it's not going to be a survey that will appear in the survey section.
26:13 Speaker B: This is a, maybe we should call it a different thing.
26:17 Speaker B: But it's like an annual update of information and annual communication of what they're seeing happening.
26:27 Speaker A: You know, maybe it could be like, have you, you ever see like Spotify or YouTube says Ah, this is your year in 2025 and it gives you all this information about what you did in this last year, year, the number of videos you saw, etc.
26:40 Speaker A: Maybe it could be like that, but the opposite.
26:42 Speaker A: It's like welcome to, or welcome to whatever season we're going to be welcoming people to.
26:49 Speaker A: And then it's, it's sort of like, I think I talked about this with Aaron, that you don't actually get access to the platform until you do this at least once a year.
26:57 Speaker A: You know, it's kind of like your login almost.
27:00 Speaker B: Yes.
27:02 Speaker B: Yeah, it's that.
27:03 Speaker B: Yeah.
27:04 Speaker B: I don't know if we should call it a different thing so that we don't confuse it with the surveys we have in the survey section.
27:10 Speaker A: I think technically it should be similar.
27:13 Speaker A: I don't think we should build.
27:14 Speaker A: I mean, just technically I'm not talking about the experience, but like inside of the platform it should be the same questions and answers and how we aggregate and we don't want to have to come up with a different plan.
27:27 Speaker A: But for the experience it can be just.
27:31 Speaker A: Yeah, you know, depends on the time when we want to do it, it kind of blocks access.
27:40 Speaker A: Blocks access is a strong word, but like, it grants access when you contribute your act of generosity.
27:47 Speaker A: Like, we want to hear from you what was helpful for you.
27:50 Speaker A: What, like what.
27:51 Speaker A: Who was a practitioner that you worked with that really supported you this year and share that with the rest of the community.
27:59 Speaker A: And then there's like a big moment of reveal, you know, it's kind of cool.
28:03 Speaker B: Yes.
28:09 Speaker B: Capturing insights from what's happening in each region is something that happens in all of our conversations.
28:15 Speaker B: Like one on one conversation.
28:17 Speaker B: Members of our communities, the Wellbeing Project team, when we have calls, we get this sense of like in a call with you, how are things, what are you sensing in your work, whatever, but it's never captured in a larger way.
28:32 Speaker B: It stays with the person who had the call and that's it.
28:36 Speaker B: So with this we want to really capture those insights, which are more qualitative insights.
28:43 Speaker B: Right.
28:44 Speaker B: Of what people feel and sense and what they wish or how things have been changing.
28:50 Speaker B: That's why we share here, like perceptions of needs, innovations, shifts in their communities.
28:57 Speaker A: Yeah, this is interesting.
28:58 Speaker A: This really gets to the heart of some of the questions that I have about, because I see this little AI part down here and I feel like they might be some relationship between these two ideas.
29:09 Speaker A: And you know, like one, one idea is to potentially actually just use the calls and we have the transcripts from the calls and then extract from those calls rather than make another moment of interaction where people are giving structured feedback.
29:25 Speaker A: But the benefit of structured feedback, there's like.
29:28 Speaker A: There's one thing I did with a wellbeing project once, which was awesome, which was triads.
29:34 Speaker A: You know, do you ever, you remember the triads?
29:37 Speaker A: Where.
29:38 Speaker B: I don't know if I was involved, like a call between three people.
29:40 Speaker A: Yeah.
29:41 Speaker A: Where the third person says what they saw.
29:44 Speaker A: And I think it's a very different experience than a machine digesting things, than having a human being say, like, okay, well, these are the needs.
29:52 Speaker A: These are like the, the questions I have about the un.
29:56 Speaker A: Like seen needs potentially that they, they didn't know how to say or how to articulate.
30:01 Speaker A: An AI, I think might be great, but you know, it will only be able to take text and it reduces the nuance of the human voice.
30:11 Speaker A: And this and the, yeah, the stammering and the slowness or the speed and all of these things and it just turns it into a stream of text.
30:18 Speaker A: And so anyway, it's a, it's a big question and it really expands the Platform to something that is, I think, harder to keep secure.
30:29 Speaker A: And like, a lot of what Aaron was saying was like, no, they can't talk to each other.
30:33 Speaker A: You know, do you remember that, like, people can't message each other and this is saying, like, one day we would like them to message each other.
30:39 Speaker A: And that feels like a philosophical, like core philosophical difference.
30:46 Speaker B: Yes, yes, I.
30:49 Speaker B: The good thing about doing it through this, like, annual survey is that you reach everyone.
30:55 Speaker B: Well, it depends on whether they answer or not, but you reach out to everyone.
31:00 Speaker B: And the cause that we have right now, it's not with 100% of the community.
31:05 Speaker A: No.
31:05 Speaker A: Yeah, that's true.
31:06 Speaker B: Yeah.
31:07 Speaker B: And another thing Aaron was telling me, like, in this annual update, in this survey, people will recommend practitioners and resources, but they still, I was telling him, like, they still need to go to the platform, click, add new facilitator, because it cannot be done through a survey.
31:26 Speaker B: Right.
31:27 Speaker A: Yeah.
31:28 Speaker A: Well, I mean, technically, yes.
31:30 Speaker A: There's no reason we couldn't design it to.
31:33 Speaker A: To have a integration with the database for resources.
31:37 Speaker A: Like during the survey, they can add content as an attachment.
31:42 Speaker B: I think you got cut off.
31:43 Speaker A: Yeah.
31:44 Speaker A: So.
31:44 Speaker A: So technically it's not impossible, but it's.
31:48 Speaker A: It's just a choice if we want them to be able to do.
31:51 Speaker B: Okay.
31:52 Speaker B: We'll need to think of what's the best experience for this annual update.
31:56 Speaker A: Yeah.
31:58 Speaker B: For the user and easier for the platform as well.
32:02 Speaker A: Yeah.
32:03 Speaker A: The annual.
32:03 Speaker A: Do you have.
32:04 Speaker A: Do you have any ideas of what the questions might be?
32:08 Speaker A: Do you have like a first draft?
32:10 Speaker B: I think we could develop that.
32:13 Speaker B: I could work on that.
32:14 Speaker B: I don't have it.
32:14 Speaker B: But it will be questions around information about like the same things, the same fields that they would fill in when adding a practitioner or resource.
32:28 Speaker B: And then about them if they change an organization, if like something around that their profile.
32:37 Speaker B: And the last one would be questions to address this.
32:43 Speaker B: No trends in the region needs innovation.
32:47 Speaker A: Yeah.
32:48 Speaker A: Interesting.
32:49 Speaker A: Is there like I remember we discussed it.
32:54 Speaker A: I don't remember the decisions about.
32:56 Speaker A: I think the decision was.
32:57 Speaker A: No, the idea was, should we have a map?
33:00 Speaker A: You know, after people put things.
33:01 Speaker A: Should we like.
33:03 Speaker A: And it was.
33:04 Speaker A: Yeah, it's if it sometimes feels like there's ambition to do more and fear for security and privacy and they're pulling at each other in attention.
33:16 Speaker A: Yeah.
33:17 Speaker B: Yes.
33:18 Speaker A: And for this first batch, for the thing that we want to do in the next few weeks where we have the 50 people or the people that, you know, we're going to work with the communications person to facilitate an onboarding with what.
33:35 Speaker A: What do we want to onboard them into?
33:38 Speaker A: Should we.
33:39 Speaker B: I would say the experience of the platform, like you have it right now to have them navigate it.
33:48 Speaker B: Experience uploading information, reading information that others have uploaded.
33:53 Speaker A: Yeah.
33:56 Speaker B: Yes, that's.
33:57 Speaker B: So no assessment answering the survey, but I don't know which one yet.
34:02 Speaker A: Why don't we try to do like the.
34:04 Speaker A: Because, Because I feel like this, the yearly survey sounds like something that Aaron really wants to do and it sounds like an important thing to be building along with survey.
34:13 Speaker A: Those are the two big surveys.
34:14 Speaker A: Right.
34:14 Speaker A: The early one and then the, the well being snapshot of well being.
34:18 Speaker A: Yeah.
34:20 Speaker A: So but the state of well being one, I don't know if it's ready.
34:22 Speaker A: So how about we take a stab at the other one and because it also does inform some platform development.
34:30 Speaker A: Meaning how do we figure out blocking people from accessing the platform until they fill it out?
34:36 Speaker A: Like how know it's actually new.
34:39 Speaker A: New pages, new features, new logic and that we don't have yet.
34:44 Speaker A: So I think that could be a good one to do.
34:49 Speaker B: I like that idea of like even in their onboarding for the first time to the platform, they should answer this.
34:56 Speaker A: Yeah.
34:58 Speaker B: And then every year.
34:59 Speaker A: Yeah.
35:00 Speaker A: I do wonder if there's a way of making it feel sort of magical somehow, you know, and like one of the ideas would be to say, okay, so we won't reveal the survey's summary until we get 75% of people completing it.
35:20 Speaker A: Right.
35:21 Speaker A: And so because what I want is like when people like submit it, I want them to see a really awesome like thing that is full of really cool content and.
35:33 Speaker A: Yeah.
35:34 Speaker A: Something rather than just, you know, filling it out, being the first one and feeling alone and.
35:40 Speaker B: Yes.
35:41 Speaker A: And then also maybe there's.
35:43 Speaker A: Yeah, there's so many things that we could do in terms of connecting people with each other that I think would be nice, you know, but it would really need some product manager decisions, you know, like, should we tell.
36:02 Speaker A: Yeah, no, I think right now is no.
36:04 Speaker A: Tell people like different organizations that they might want to reach out to.
36:08 Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
36:11 Speaker A: Related to the question.
36:11 Speaker B: And I have that point here.
36:14 Speaker A: Yeah.
36:15 Speaker B: The last one, but then I added more.
36:20 Speaker A: Okay.
36:21 Speaker A: Yeah.
36:22 Speaker B: And to be confirmed because you know.
36:24 Speaker A: There'S, there's a way of making it.
36:27 Speaker A: I don't know if this makes any sense.
36:28 Speaker A: I was thinking people understand LinkedIn and if we just give that then at least we don't have to deal with any of the relationship building liability or anything like that.
36:42 Speaker A: It's just like a professional network.
36:44 Speaker A: But.
36:45 Speaker A: Yeah, but the difference is we Only have organizations.
36:48 Speaker A: So there's no individuals.
36:49 Speaker A: So do we only link to organizations?
36:52 Speaker A: LinkedIns and people have to search for each other.
36:55 Speaker A: I'm just thinking about a breadcrumb, you know, like a Hansel and Gretel.
36:57 Speaker A: Like maybe we can't build the communication process and connection right now, but at least give people like, you know, if you put in some effort, you can like, you know, you met somebody at that conference and you want to figure out who they were.
37:11 Speaker A: Oh, now you have their LinkedIn, their organization.
37:14 Speaker A: Oh.
37:14 Speaker A: And then you see who works in that.
37:15 Speaker A: I don't know.
37:16 Speaker A: I'm not sure.
37:18 Speaker B: I know it's.
37:19 Speaker B: I met like in a battle, internal battle, because I, I love that idea of connecting people and facilitating connections and I.
37:30 Speaker B: But I think we need to be patient like right now to test, to test this initial purpose of a platform which is like what the name says, to help people springboard to other places with resources and resources.
37:45 Speaker A: What are the other things?
37:47 Speaker A: So we can send them to a resource.
37:49 Speaker A: We can send them.
37:51 Speaker A: That's it really.
37:52 Speaker B: Practitioner.
37:52 Speaker A: Practitioner resources.
37:53 Speaker A: Practitioners.
37:54 Speaker A: And the surveys are kind of how they navigate in a way, right?
38:01 Speaker B: Yes.
38:01 Speaker B: And once the surveys are populated, this analytic, like the data will also serve as a support for when they like evidence or.
38:13 Speaker B: Yeah.
38:13 Speaker B: Data they can use to make a case for this.
38:17 Speaker A: Yeah.
38:18 Speaker A: Let's think about this, these questions for the survey because I think that's what I'd like to build next to be able to get people onto it and just get real experience.
38:30 Speaker A: Experience.
38:30 Speaker A: There's the.
38:32 Speaker A: Let's say that we're going to do this onboarding survey.
38:35 Speaker A: What, you know, the state of, you know, like new research or other things like that.
38:39 Speaker A: Maybe even if they have a practitioner on the onboarding survey, they can, they can fill out that profile and then they hit submit.
38:49 Speaker A: Do they get to see that or is that somehow aggregated and put into their organization?
39:00 Speaker B: Do they get.
39:01 Speaker B: Get to see.
39:02 Speaker B: You mean like a summary of what they have submitted?
39:05 Speaker A: Yeah.
39:08 Speaker B: I don't.
39:09 Speaker B: They would see it on the platform because it will be populated.
39:13 Speaker B: No, their practitioners would be in the part of practitioners.
39:16 Speaker B: But I don't know if there's.
39:17 Speaker B: There should be a section where it says like your.
39:21 Speaker B: Uhhuh.
39:23 Speaker B: Your contributions or like something like that.
39:26 Speaker B: I don't know.
39:27 Speaker A: Yeah, let me, Let me actually go to the platform right now and see because we have the, you know, there's a few steps in a way.
39:37 Speaker A: There's like I.
39:39 Speaker A: There's the admin of an organization.
39:42 Speaker A: So see, when you log in right now, it Says, well, being projects role, primary administration.
39:48 Speaker A: And so that's me.
39:49 Speaker A: Right.
39:49 Speaker A: And I get to, I get to see.
39:51 Speaker B: You can enter.
39:53 Speaker B: All right.
39:53 Speaker A: Yeah.
39:54 Speaker A: Oh, I don't know if you're logged in.
39:55 Speaker A: Are you logged in?
39:57 Speaker B: I think so, yes.
39:59 Speaker A: Yeah.
39:59 Speaker A: So over here I can manage the members.
40:01 Speaker A: I can see like all the providers that people in my organization have recommended, but that's just me.
40:10 Speaker A: Yeah.
40:11 Speaker A: Service provider manage members, find providers.
40:14 Speaker A: Yeah.
40:15 Speaker A: And then if you go back to the main dashboard, the person, when they log in and they're not an admin, they just see service providers, resources, surveys, you know, they don't have the dashboard.
40:28 Speaker A: Is that what, is that what we want or should we just have like a different view for the organization that has some summary or something.
40:45 Speaker B: Without the manage members?
40:47 Speaker B: Because it will be only them.
40:49 Speaker A: Yeah, it'll just be them.
40:51 Speaker A: Should it?
40:52 Speaker A: Yeah.
40:52 Speaker A: Will it show all the providers, the members in their organization shared?
40:56 Speaker A: Does that make sense?
40:58 Speaker B: So if, if I, I don't know, like, why would I.
41:05 Speaker B: What.
41:08 Speaker B: All right.
41:09 Speaker B: I'm thinking a lot of things at the same time.
41:12 Speaker B: Me, like as an individual, I would like to see what I have contributed just to be clear that what I want to share has been shared.
41:20 Speaker B: I think that's the only.
41:22 Speaker B: Yeah, I.
41:24 Speaker B: Are you.
41:25 Speaker A: Yeah.
41:26 Speaker B: Are you hearing.
41:27 Speaker A: I'm hearing you.
41:28 Speaker A: Well, yeah, that makes sense.
41:29 Speaker A: I think maybe I need to make a provider page and then I can say, say like filter for, you know, just my providers or something like that.
41:36 Speaker A: Just my resources.
41:38 Speaker A: And maybe that should be what I click in the dashboard of the organization when I'm, when I'm in that dashboard.
41:46 Speaker A: I want to see what I contributed because that's basically their, their, their contribution is sort of first to their whole organization.
41:54 Speaker A: Right.
41:55 Speaker A: It's because everybody else it does will see it in this kind of summary view.
42:00 Speaker A: The admin will see it.
42:02 Speaker A: Yeah.
42:03 Speaker B: Yes.
42:05 Speaker B: I don't know what else.
42:07 Speaker B: Like, why would we need this recap other than the reason I shared, what other ideas do you think why this would be necessary?
42:17 Speaker A: Yeah, let me think.
42:20 Speaker A: Like, let's say that we didn't have the your organizations button and they just went to resources.
42:25 Speaker A: For instance.
42:27 Speaker A: Maybe instead, instead of upload resources, there could be another button at the top that says view my uploaded resources or my resources.
42:36 Speaker A: I think that probably is a better idea.
42:38 Speaker A: You know, instead of upload over here, it says my.
42:40 Speaker A: My resources.
42:42 Speaker A: And it's just one button and it just filters everything so they can see what they uploaded and then we don't need the complexity of like my org.
42:50 Speaker B: Yes.
42:51 Speaker A: Yeah, that.
42:51 Speaker A: That works.
42:52 Speaker A: And then we got to think about the survey.
42:54 Speaker A: Survey.
42:55 Speaker A: Okay, so this is a bunch of different.
42:57 Speaker A: Okay.
42:58 Speaker A: Yeah.
42:59 Speaker A: So the surveys are currently for the admin to deploy.
43:07 Speaker A: What happens if I deploy it?
43:15 Speaker A: Oh, did we decide on the.
43:18 Speaker A: The closing date or not?
43:19 Speaker A: Like, did we want to have a.
43:21 Speaker A: A closing date for things.
43:24 Speaker B: What do you mean?
43:25 Speaker A: Closing date for a survey?
43:27 Speaker A: So you.
43:28 Speaker A: It starts on this day and then it ends on.
43:31 Speaker A: On this day.
43:35 Speaker B: Since I don't know what surveys will be launched here, I think it will depend.
43:41 Speaker A: Okay.
43:44 Speaker B: Or because we will continuously want to like survey the community.
43:49 Speaker B: But maybe it will be, aha.
43:53 Speaker B: You do need to put a time frame to it.
43:55 Speaker B: No.
43:55 Speaker B: So that the data can be relevant.
43:57 Speaker B: Like 2026, 2025, assessment of this and then next year it's the update.
44:03 Speaker A: Yeah.
44:04 Speaker A: Having a deadline is helpful for data analysis.
44:09 Speaker A: It's like, okay, we've.
44:11 Speaker A: And then also for communications and for comms and saying, okay, so the window for your contributions is closing.
44:18 Speaker A: You have five days to submit your survey.
44:21 Speaker A: Join the movement.
44:22 Speaker A: Something like that.
44:24 Speaker A: And then we get to have a call.
44:25 Speaker A: Right.
44:26 Speaker A: Like we can display the data and we can do a little.
44:30 Speaker A: But if we don't have a closing date and we just say someday.
44:35 Speaker B: It'S no, no, no.
44:36 Speaker B: Yeah, I agree.
44:37 Speaker B: I think in this conversation we're moving to.
44:40 Speaker B: Yes.
44:41 Speaker B: Having a closing date.
44:42 Speaker A: Yeah, Closing date.
44:45 Speaker A: I think that's a good idea.
44:46 Speaker B: And once the surveys are answered, people will enter this section of surveys and here they'll see like analytics or they need to click on it.
44:58 Speaker B: How do you see that?
44:59 Speaker A: I think I need to change how the, the surveys work right now.
45:01 Speaker A: Because right now it's different.
45:03 Speaker A: Right.
45:03 Speaker A: Right now it's designed so that somebody.
45:08 Speaker A: Yeah.
45:08 Speaker A: Can like deploy different surveys instead of the well Being project deploying surveys.
45:12 Speaker A: Right.
45:13 Speaker B: Yes.
45:15 Speaker A: And that's not what we want.
45:17 Speaker A: Is that correct?
45:18 Speaker A: We don't want organizations to be able to deploy their own surveys.
45:24 Speaker B: No, it's just surveys that are created by the well Being Project.
45:28 Speaker A: Okay.
45:30 Speaker B: Are the surveys that can be here and then the organization can take it and share it with their community.
45:36 Speaker A: Yeah.
45:36 Speaker A: And then it's.
45:40 Speaker A: They share the links.
45:41 Speaker A: Remember we had this discussion about the issue of two organizations that are too small and then being able to have identifiable information.
45:54 Speaker A: Did you.
45:55 Speaker A: How do you think we should think about that?
45:57 Speaker A: Or is that like an edge case we don't need to worry about?
46:02 Speaker B: I think like the last thing we said, I think was like, if an organization has less than seven people, we won't share the data aggregated by that organization.
46:14 Speaker B: But the.
46:15 Speaker B: But it will be used for the data of the region or the sector or like the whole field.
46:23 Speaker B: The only view you won't see is per organization because then they will identify who is answering.
46:32 Speaker B: No, it will be answering.
46:33 Speaker B: It will be easier to make those connections and lose a anonymity.
46:37 Speaker A: Yeah, I think, I think that that's.
46:39 Speaker B: The last thing I remember that makes.
46:41 Speaker A: A lot of sense and I think one of the.
46:43 Speaker A: The first things that people should do is select a region.
46:49 Speaker A: Right.
46:49 Speaker A: Do you have a taxonomy of regions for.
46:52 Speaker B: Yes.
46:52 Speaker A: Well being Summer well being project?
46:56 Speaker B: Yes.
46:57 Speaker A: Yeah, that would be great.
46:58 Speaker A: Because then.
46:59 Speaker B: Yes we do.
47:00 Speaker B: And also sectors, like areas of work, I think.
47:04 Speaker B: So we could use that for the, for the onboarding service as well.
47:09 Speaker A: Yeah, for the onboarding survey, but also for the summaries.
47:13 Speaker A: Right.
47:13 Speaker A: Because let's say that they won't be able to see their results because they're too small, but they can see how their results contributed to the sector, how their results contributed to.
47:23 Speaker A: To the.
47:23 Speaker A: Exactly the region that they're in, etc.
47:29 Speaker A: And yes, should we save their data itemized or aggregated?
47:37 Speaker A: I feel like it should be aggregated because the long term vision, even though it does have this tension between individual and collective and it is philosophically confused to be.
47:51 Speaker A: Yeah, to be clear, it's.
47:52 Speaker A: It's like you want to have your cake and eat it too, you know, a little bit.
47:57 Speaker A: But if you want to eat your cake, it does need to be itemized probably at some point and then, then.
48:05 Speaker B: But what if like I do think we need them at an individual level?
48:10 Speaker B: Excuse me, sorry.
48:12 Speaker B: No, no worries.
48:13 Speaker B: I feel sorry that you're sick and that we're here having this like conversation.
48:18 Speaker A: Like I said, it requires thinking, distraction.
48:20 Speaker A: I could have been like all I was doing the whole day was lying in bed and this is, this is good for me, I think.
48:26 Speaker A: Inshallah.
48:26 Speaker A: Alhamdulillah.
48:29 Speaker B: Okay, so I was going to tell you that I think we do need them at the individual level because you need to count how many have answered in order to aggregate them at the organizational level.
48:47 Speaker A: No.
48:47 Speaker B: So how do you decide when to delete the data at the individual level and not lose that count to be able to aggregate at the organizational.
48:58 Speaker B: Am I explaining myself?
49:01 Speaker A: I didn't understand.
49:02 Speaker A: Could you try again?
49:03 Speaker B: No.
49:04 Speaker B: See if five people from an organization respond and you don't save the data at an individual level, you start aggregating it to the sector or the region.
49:16 Speaker B: How do you know that it was five?
49:18 Speaker B: And when three more respond and you now have eight.
49:22 Speaker A: I do feel like there is some special math that we can do.
49:26 Speaker A: Like some very interesting statistical processes that I can look into that would be able to keep track of that, to be able to have the good mean mode, average standard deviation, you know, all of that important statistical information while like keeping things aggregated.
49:45 Speaker A: But I'm not sure I'd have to look into it.
49:47 Speaker A: But I do feel like I. I have heard about that working in the.
49:50 Speaker B: Past and if it's a problem, if it starts becoming a problem, then let's keep it at the individual level.
49:56 Speaker B: But anonymous.
49:57 Speaker B: No.
49:58 Speaker A: Yeah, I think like just the questions were about security.
50:02 Speaker A: Right.
50:03 Speaker A: And so the.
50:04 Speaker A: The safest thing is just to not save it.
50:07 Speaker A: The second safest thing is to do what like banks do, right.
50:11 Speaker A: Which is high security, two factor authentication, you know, like using encryption for uploading and encryption on the web.
50:20 Speaker A: You know, like there is a way of doing it securely.
50:23 Speaker A: We don't have to.
50:26 Speaker A: It's just the easiest thing to do.
50:28 Speaker A: You know, and least technical and least error prone.
50:32 Speaker A: You know, the simpler something is.
50:35 Speaker A: They call it attack surface.
50:36 Speaker A: You know, when something is really big and really complicated, you could like find a back door or you can like dig underneath or you can like jump into the top or.
50:46 Speaker A: But if something is just like a sphere, it's like something very simple.
50:49 Speaker A: There's less ways of figuring out how to, you know, figure it out.
50:54 Speaker A: So it is less of a risk.
50:56 Speaker A: But also, you know, banks do it.
50:58 Speaker A: We should be able to do it.
50:59 Speaker A: It's not.
51:00 Speaker A: It's not the most complicated thing, I think.
51:04 Speaker B: Okay.
51:05 Speaker A: Okay.
51:08 Speaker A: You want to look at the table?
51:09 Speaker A: I think it might be interesting to think about the timeline and then, you know, maybe.
51:17 Speaker A: Sorry.
51:18 Speaker B: So here I just wanted to explain.
51:20 Speaker B: Coordinator is a role like of a junior role who will be supporting me with a. Yeah.
51:26 Speaker B: Emails, focus groups, scheduling, community holding and that person, I think, because I already started interviewing people, I think they will join February.
51:39 Speaker A: Okay, cool.
51:40 Speaker B: This person, but it's coordinator like to help with the operation tasks like administrative and things like that.
51:48 Speaker B: And then the owner is this person.
51:52 Speaker B: I have talked to Aaron about that.
51:54 Speaker B: We need a more senior person in the team that will really hold this platform.
51:58 Speaker B: Platform once it's done and we launch a.
52:01 Speaker B: To the whole community and like once it's tested, who will this person be?
52:06 Speaker B: So that's what I'm referring to.
52:07 Speaker A: There might also be where the support emails go and where.
52:11 Speaker B: Yes.
52:12 Speaker A: People are confused.
52:14 Speaker B: Yes.
52:14 Speaker A: Yeah.
52:15 Speaker B: Yes.
52:16 Speaker B: And it's not the animator.
52:17 Speaker A: You don't think.
52:18 Speaker A: Yeah, it can't be the same person.
52:19 Speaker B: No, because this is too junior.
52:21 Speaker A: Okay.
52:22 Speaker A: But yeah, you don't think the job could be consolidated and just hire a more senior person?
52:30 Speaker B: Aha.
52:30 Speaker B: That's what I said.
52:31 Speaker B: But then right now we cannot hire a senior person.
52:34 Speaker B: So we have to start with a junior person.
52:40 Speaker B: But yes, and then development team.
52:44 Speaker B: This one, I put it here as an idea.
52:47 Speaker B: Like right now, working with you, I think we're advancing at a very great pace.
52:53 Speaker B: The wireframes look amazing.
52:54 Speaker B: To start the tests, I don't know if in the future we will need a larger team and build a more robust software platform and migrate what we have right now to another solution, but I don't know.
53:08 Speaker B: So thinking of that, I'm putting this here.
53:11 Speaker B: Like maybe we'll need a larger team.
53:13 Speaker A: I mean the tech stack is fine.
53:18 Speaker A: It's like good quality tech stack.
53:22 Speaker A: One of the questions actually I forgot to bring up was data privacy.
53:26 Speaker A: Where are we storing our servers?
53:28 Speaker A: Is it going to be European servers?
53:30 Speaker A: Like this whole GDPR thing?
53:32 Speaker A: But we're on production grade stuff.
53:35 Speaker A: The only reason it went down is because it's a prototype feature and if you don't use it, it says why am I wasting energy running the server?
53:49 Speaker A: He's probably done with this prototype and once we deploy it and pay for the monthly service then it won't have that problem.
54:02 Speaker B: And you know best like of what solution would work.
54:04 Speaker B: So that's also why this is in red.
54:07 Speaker B: Because I don't know if another more robust thing will be needed or not.
54:11 Speaker A: I think more robust would be great, especially for things like.
54:15 Speaker B: Okay, and then the legal team.
54:18 Speaker B: It's in red.
54:19 Speaker A: Hello.
54:20 Speaker B: Clarity on who will be supporting with this.
54:22 Speaker B: Aaron is the one who knows that.
54:26 Speaker A: In terms of technical support, then the parts that I, I'm not good at or I don't really like to work on is UI and making things look good.
54:38 Speaker A: I like making things work.
54:40 Speaker A: And so if you wanted people to continue to advance the user interface and like the quality of how things.
54:47 Speaker B: I, I lost you.
54:48 Speaker A: Oh, okay.
54:50 Speaker A: Yeah.
54:51 Speaker A: Hello.
54:52 Speaker A: We'll see, we'll see about the, the dev team.
54:55 Speaker B: Maybe I, I lost you when you said I don't like working UI and then.
55:01 Speaker A: Yeah, it's not my, my forte.
55:03 Speaker B: You said I'm great.
55:04 Speaker B: I like making things work.
55:06 Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
55:08 Speaker A: I, I like to make things work.
55:09 Speaker A: But if somebody wants to like make it.
55:12 Speaker B: But you got cut off.
55:13 Speaker B: Oh no.
55:14 Speaker A: Okay, let me try my tethering again.
55:18 Speaker A: One second.
55:21 Speaker B: Okay, but this is, I, I.
55:39 Speaker B: Do you hear me correctly?
55:41 Speaker A: Yeah.
55:50 Speaker A: Okay.
55:50 Speaker A: I'm just typing in case it's.
55:55 Speaker B: No, I, I hear you, I hear you.
55:57 Speaker B: And I'm seeing you're typing too, but I think we're back.
56:00 Speaker A: It should be good.
56:03 Speaker A: Who.
56:04 Speaker A: And that's actually something really important because actually at the end of this document, there was like this 14 weeks plus there was a budget for it and the handover.
56:14 Speaker A: And I was like, is that like a monthly budget?
56:17 Speaker A: Is that like forever?
56:18 Speaker A: Like, what's.
56:21 Speaker A: Yes.
56:22 Speaker A: And.
56:22 Speaker A: And who will be like the, the tech team?
56:27 Speaker A: I think especially if there's all these dreams for it.
56:31 Speaker A: It does need a product owner and then probably some tech people I can be available for patches, improvements, things like that.
56:44 Speaker A: And then maybe instead of having this thing being like 14 weeks plus or something like that, we say like, okay, so after the handover, we call this contract done and then we decide whether or not we want to do another one or something like that.
57:03 Speaker B: Plus it's like week 14 onwards.
57:06 Speaker B: We really don't know.
57:07 Speaker B: Like, I, I'm sure things will change in these three months and we really don't know what will happen.
57:13 Speaker B: A week 14 onwards.
57:16 Speaker B: What?
57:23 Speaker B: Completing the platform and the budget is one.
57:28 Speaker B: It's one shot for that phase.
57:30 Speaker B: So phase one, 2000 with the first test.
57:36 Speaker B: 30 participants.
57:37 Speaker B: No, five participants.
57:40 Speaker B: The first thing is building the.
57:42 Speaker B: These three weeks is building the platform.
57:44 Speaker B: Testing it internally with the welding project team.
57:47 Speaker B: Yeah.
57:47 Speaker B: And choosing who from the network will participate in the testing with these first 30.
57:55 Speaker B: But it's like setting it up for the testing.
57:57 Speaker B: No.
57:57 Speaker A: Yeah.
57:58 Speaker B: And.
57:58 Speaker B: And we have 2,000 for that.
58:00 Speaker B: And then phase two will be starting with the testing of these 30.
58:09 Speaker B: Fixing the platform, receiving their feedback.
58:13 Speaker B: Yeah, all of that.
58:14 Speaker A: Once a feedback button.
58:16 Speaker A: Actually there's 2, 2, 1.
58:17 Speaker A: Two things that I want to ask about this.
58:20 Speaker A: We could store what people search as a list.
58:24 Speaker A: We don't even have to say who stores it.
58:26 Speaker A: But I feel like what people search is really insightful as to what they're looking for.
58:32 Speaker A: Literally, you know.
58:34 Speaker B: Yes.
58:35 Speaker A: And so it's.
58:36 Speaker A: But that just includes, like, opens up another one of these privacy issues.
58:41 Speaker A: It's, you know, obviously safer not to store that.
58:43 Speaker A: But it could be anonymous.
58:47 Speaker A: You know, we could review it occasionally just to see how people are using it.
58:52 Speaker B: And the other thing that's 100% to.
58:55 Speaker A: That is do we need a feature page where people can request features or submit contact?
59:06 Speaker B: I don't think so.
59:08 Speaker B: Tracking their searches I think will be insightful in doing anonymously.
59:16 Speaker B: I think that would be really great.
59:18 Speaker B: But having a page for them to share Their ideas of new features and things.
59:23 Speaker B: I think right now we don't need that.
59:25 Speaker B: We'll be doing the focus groups, we'll be receiving feedback in that way, but it's all going to be filtered by us.
59:30 Speaker B: And I don't know if we want to open it up so much.
59:33 Speaker A: Okay, so yeah, maybe just the form for the coordinator or something like that.
59:40 Speaker A: Like an email address for the coordinator.
59:42 Speaker A: Like if you have any questions or concerns, ideas, just email this person.
59:48 Speaker B: Yes, yes, yes.
59:52 Speaker B: Okay, so phase two is with the group of 30, testing, adding, fixing, and that is 1.€500 for this first test batch of 30.
60:06 Speaker B: And then phase three, we want to do a scaled launch still with batches of 30, but scale.
60:15 Speaker B: So yeah, another 30 to, to three weeks, another 30 to three weeks and start building the community in that way.
60:22 Speaker A: I like that.
60:22 Speaker A: Yeah.
60:24 Speaker B: And doing this, this is going to be so exciting.
60:27 Speaker A: It's so cool.
60:28 Speaker A: I'm, I'm really excited because it's, it's going to be like a, you know, walking upstairs every time we do another batch.
60:35 Speaker A: It's going to get better.
60:36 Speaker B: And yes, it's going to be cool.
60:39 Speaker B: And for this phase, like this second testing and scaled soft launch, it's another 2,500.
60:49 Speaker B: So here in total it's 6,000 up until week 13.
60:56 Speaker A: Okay.
60:56 Speaker B: Okay.
60:57 Speaker A: The question is, should we put like a 14 through 24?
61:02 Speaker A: So there's an end point for the.
61:06 Speaker A: Because right now it's just like open ended.
61:11 Speaker B: It's open ended right now because I don't have much clarity of how things will advance if the batches of 30 will work.
61:18 Speaker B: Like, I don't know.
61:20 Speaker B: So I just put here like I was talking with Aaron, like we do want to fully reach the 1200 organizations that are part of our community.
61:29 Speaker A: Wow.
61:30 Speaker A: Yeah.
61:32 Speaker B: Yes.
61:32 Speaker B: But I don't know if that will be like, if maybe we'll decide to keep doing the batches of 30 until we reach the 1200.
61:39 Speaker B: I don't know.
61:41 Speaker A: I sort of feel like, you know, I'm not just a technical person.
61:45 Speaker A: I also have facilitation capabilities and you know, I'm not sure how we're deciding on the focus groups.
61:53 Speaker A: And I like the idea of making the batch of 30 a cool experience no matter what.
62:01 Speaker A: You know, it's not like, here, try this broken software.
62:03 Speaker A: It's like, it's like, let's make it really cool.
62:07 Speaker A: And you get to meet other people from the community.
62:09 Speaker A: We get to try this tool.
62:11 Speaker A: Your feedback really matters.
62:13 Speaker A: And you know, Gita's here and he's listening and he can actually change things based on your feedback.
62:19 Speaker A: And let's.
62:19 Speaker A: So making it really fun, no matter what I think is.
62:24 Speaker B: And it's part of phase one these first weeks, it's choosing who will be a part of that, designing that experience.
62:32 Speaker B: I also put here like designing the annual survey.
62:36 Speaker B: It's part of the first phase.
62:41 Speaker B: And in this first phase we're only testing with the wellbeing project.
62:45 Speaker B: So we'll have a session with five people from our team to test it.
62:50 Speaker A: Okay, yeah, let's, let's do that.
62:53 Speaker A: And I think it'll answer a lot of questions about some of the open ended, you know, problem spaces for sector versus, you know, region.
63:06 Speaker A: And do you get to see aggregate for everything?
63:10 Speaker A: So whenever you get a chance, if you can give me the survey and do you know what the fields will be like?
63:21 Speaker A: Will they all be long form text sliders.
63:28 Speaker B: For the annual or for the games we want to deploy?
63:34 Speaker A: We're starting with the annual, right?
63:35 Speaker A: With the simulation of the annual one?
63:39 Speaker B: Yes.
63:43 Speaker B: I don't know if long text would be an option because we want them to update information about them and that would be from fields that are like region, sector, that should be from a drop down list or something.
64:01 Speaker B: And then we want them to share practitioners and resources, structured data.
64:06 Speaker B: And that needs to be like concrete data that they need to share so that it's uploaded as a practitioner or a resource and then about the insights of their region.
64:15 Speaker A: That's where it gets a little freaky.
64:17 Speaker B: If we make it open.
64:21 Speaker A: Yeah.
64:21 Speaker A: How would you do that?
64:23 Speaker B: Sorry?
64:23 Speaker A: How would you do the insights if.
64:26 Speaker B: You make it open text?
64:29 Speaker B: Huh.
64:29 Speaker B: I'm thinking like the easiest way for them to share is in open text because they just write what they, what they're seeing and their sense of the region and the field and things like that.
64:41 Speaker B: But then how do you aggregate that into something that can be measured and shown as analytics?
64:46 Speaker A: Yeah, I developed a process that I call here, I call it sar, cred, Confidence, Rationale, Evidence, decision.
65:00 Speaker A: And it's essentially a process for taking free text.
65:05 Speaker A: And then the problem with LLMs is that they hallucinate.
65:10 Speaker A: Right?
65:10 Speaker A: They make stuff up.
65:11 Speaker B: Yes.
65:12 Speaker A: But if you say to this LLM that I want you to return structured data and JSON and I don't, I want you to actually look, there's also something called an adaptive taxonomy.
65:26 Speaker A: So it starts with maybe a few ideas that you might have for what the insights might be.
65:33 Speaker A: Right.
65:33 Speaker A: It could be new research, it could be a challenge, it could be an open Question.
65:39 Speaker A: And so that could be the taxonomy, but it could also be adaptive, meaning that it adds something.
65:48 Speaker A: If the tool doesn't find something to structure the person's response to, it would add a new element.
65:57 Speaker A: And then the reason why I came up with this idea for cred, it's just the acronym is because of hallucination.
66:05 Speaker A: And I want source documentation so we actually save their text.
66:11 Speaker A: And instead of just saying, well, the LLM thinks you have a question about the field, it would actually have structured data and then it would be able to get, give you confidence and then it would be able to give you a rationale which helps it have a stronger connection to something that's reasonable evidence means CRE evidence is the, the plain text.
66:36 Speaker A: Exactly as the person put it.
66:38 Speaker A: And so the LLM will say, here's what I think, here's why I think that.
66:43 Speaker A: And then here is the evidence.
66:45 Speaker A: And then decision is what drop down item is selected.
66:50 Speaker A: Does that make sense?
66:52 Speaker B: Well, yes.
66:53 Speaker A: Yeah.
66:54 Speaker A: So, so I built that for some of these other processes that I'm doing with LLMs because I've had that problem too with like qualitative quantitative stuff.
67:03 Speaker A: And I wanted to be able to have a high quality quantitative extract but have people be able to speak freely and like.
67:13 Speaker A: Yeah.
67:13 Speaker A: Came up with this.
67:16 Speaker B: Wow.
67:16 Speaker A: Yeah, we could try it.
67:18 Speaker A: The only problem.
67:19 Speaker B: Well, it's exactly what I'm saying.
67:21 Speaker B: Like, I think you're.
67:22 Speaker B: Yes.
67:23 Speaker B: Right on high.
67:24 Speaker B: It's the same thing I'm mentioning.
67:27 Speaker A: Well, yeah, the only problem with it is it adds another potential cost.
67:32 Speaker A: I don't think it'll be a lot.
67:34 Speaker A: It won't be that many API calls, but especially if we only use it once a year, it might add like, I don't know, $50 or something for the processing of all of the data.
67:47 Speaker B: Okay.
67:48 Speaker A: And we can do it on a local, like open source LLM.
67:52 Speaker A: Oh, yeah, maybe.
67:54 Speaker A: There was a process I was thinking through.
67:58 Speaker A: You talked about push notifications.
68:00 Speaker A: We talked about like all this privacy stuff.
68:03 Speaker A: And that requires the mobile app essentially.
68:11 Speaker A: And we have a web application right now and I don't know, is that something that you guys are interested?
68:17 Speaker A: It won't be too much more difficult.
68:19 Speaker A: It's just another platform to develop and we get to decide that today.
68:26 Speaker A: We could actually build something in something called React Native.
68:30 Speaker A: And React Native allows you to export something for the web and export something for iOS and something for Android.
68:37 Speaker A: The goal would be to write.
68:39 Speaker B: No, I, I think a web app is more than enough.
68:44 Speaker B: Where we have not talked about having an iOS or Android app.
68:48 Speaker B: And when I put the push notifications, maybe it's not the correct term to use and sorry for that confusion, but I was referring to evaluating these messages that we're gonna send out to users to their some way of communicating aha.
69:08 Speaker B: Or notifications in the app that will appear.
69:13 Speaker B: What we had said about having like an inbox where we share messages in the dashboard, that's what I'm referring to in this notification strategy.
69:22 Speaker B: Maybe I just put.
69:23 Speaker B: Put notification strategy without the push or how would you call that?
69:27 Speaker A: Push notifications is.
69:28 Speaker A: Yeah.
69:29 Speaker A: For pushing into somebody's phone.
69:32 Speaker A: So that would just be a notification strategy and it could connect.
69:36 Speaker B: Okay.
69:36 Speaker A: When that notification happens, there can be an associated email.
69:40 Speaker A: Right.
69:41 Speaker A: So let's say that they get something on the platform and it updated the dashboard.
69:47 Speaker A: They should probably email, say, hey, go check the platform.
69:51 Speaker A: This is, this is something new.
69:54 Speaker A: You have a new assessment or you have a new survey.
69:56 Speaker B: Yes, yes, I'm gonna.
69:59 Speaker B: There we go.
70:00 Speaker B: I deleted.
70:02 Speaker B: I just left notification strategy.
70:05 Speaker A: Okay.
70:06 Speaker B: Okay.
70:07 Speaker A: Yeah, things are getting clear.
70:08 Speaker A: I'm also, I think there's this idea of the dashboard that's getting more clear.
70:14 Speaker A: Instead of having you know like a bell item drop down for notifications, I think maybe just when you log in, instead of the three buttons only, maybe we turn those three buttons into a header item for three header buttons and then the dashboard shows whatever the last year's survey aggregate data is and then a list of surveys or a list of notifications, things like that.
70:40 Speaker A: So that you go.
70:41 Speaker B: Yes.
70:41 Speaker B: And right now could we put a sample data to start like for when we test to have a.
70:51 Speaker B: This fictional survey responses or something.
70:56 Speaker A: I made a bunch of fictional facilitators, practitioners.
71:01 Speaker A: But yeah, once you give me the survey, I'll.
71:04 Speaker A: I'll make some sample data.
71:08 Speaker B: Okay.
71:09 Speaker B: Would it work if I share it like on a Google Doc?
71:18 Speaker B: I'm thinking how to share a spreadsheet the elements.
71:24 Speaker B: Right, because of the drop down tables.
71:25 Speaker A: Yeah, you can make the questions and you can say file upload here if you want somebody to be able to upload the A PDF or something.
71:38 Speaker B: Okay, okay.
71:42 Speaker B: And in this survey I want to.
71:48 Speaker B: I.
71:51 Speaker A: Okay.
72:02 Speaker B: Right.
72:04 Speaker A: Yeah, maybe we can.
72:07 Speaker A: I don't know if you guys have any taxonomies that you have would be helpful.
72:11 Speaker A: So a taxonomy is like, you know, languages that are commonly used in the well being project.
72:17 Speaker A: You have that, that already defined and in the service provider, you see there's also service provider types, CBT and others.
72:26 Speaker A: So I'm not sure, like yeah, burnout recovery, collective trauma I you know I kind of came up with all of these and I'm wondering if you.
72:35 Speaker A: If you have a taxonomies for the well being projects, practitioner types or things like that.
72:46 Speaker B: Okay.
72:47 Speaker B: We don't have them for the practitioner type specifically but we do have like for the organizations that are part of our community, the focus of their work, the area of work sector.
73:00 Speaker B: So yeah, I'll look into that and share those with you once I start developing the how this survey should look.
73:08 Speaker A: Yeah, I think that would be good.
73:10 Speaker A: Any, any taxonomies will be helpful and then also like if you have copy that you feel like really represents sense the well being projects way of communicating you know or brand guidelines that would be helpful too.
73:27 Speaker B: Okay.
73:28 Speaker B: Aaron shared this idea like he's been having the idea of branding the platform as with the Hearth branding but kind.
73:41 Speaker A: Of nice because the conversation to the regional.
73:45 Speaker A: Right.
73:46 Speaker B: Yes, yes.
73:49 Speaker B: There's still a conversation pending with the Marco's team and the well being project.
73:55 Speaker B: I think we'll have clarity on that soon.
73:58 Speaker B: Tuesday I'm present the wireframes like going into the dashboard and sharing it with the leaders in the well being project and our plan overview of the plan.
74:16 Speaker B: No, they understand, it's like they understand it's a prototype so if something doesn't work it's no problem and I'll let you know.
74:24 Speaker B: But I think we're good with how it is right now and from there I think we'll have an answer soon.
74:31 Speaker B: On the branding and questions I have of like who from legal will be supporting with this?
74:41 Speaker B: The team that's working in the state of well being reports.
74:45 Speaker B: There's two leads that are managing that project.
74:47 Speaker B: I think they can help us with the questions that you brought about statistics and probability and how to create these surveys and make sure that it's really anonymous and I think they can share.
75:01 Speaker A: Because also I was wondering what data do you guys need and how do you need to take it out?
75:06 Speaker A: Right.
75:07 Speaker A: So we actually need the Wellbeing project admin login that actually gives deeper access to the data.
75:14 Speaker A: Right.
75:14 Speaker A: And to be able to extract the CSV or.
75:18 Speaker B: Yeah.
75:19 Speaker A: I'm not sure how.
75:20 Speaker A: How the data analysis works.
75:22 Speaker A: Do you guys use tableau or.
75:27 Speaker B: No clue.
75:29 Speaker A: Yeah.
75:29 Speaker A: Because yeah.
75:30 Speaker A: I mean the easiest, simplest thing is a CSV but it's.
75:34 Speaker B: It's pretty, huh?
75:35 Speaker A: Yeah.
75:38 Speaker B: Okay.
75:38 Speaker A: Transferable.
75:41 Speaker B: And for the next like I put here starting of January but we could move it one week further out.
75:49 Speaker B: It's no problem.
75:51 Speaker B: Like for this first phase.
75:53 Speaker A: Yeah.
75:53 Speaker B: Of weeks one, two, three.
75:57 Speaker B: If we start next week with as week one.
76:04 Speaker B: No, I don't know if next week but I wanted to know like from your side, how does this first phase look for doing the focus with five people in the well being project?
76:20 Speaker B: Start populating the platform and start designing.
76:24 Speaker A: How the test with the.
76:26 Speaker A: The survey that you'll make.
76:28 Speaker A: And then I think we're doing that sometime, you know, next week or whenever.
76:34 Speaker A: Whenever you finish the survey.
76:36 Speaker A: I'll work on developing that.
76:39 Speaker A: Hey, it looks like this is your first time logging in before seeing the survey.
76:45 Speaker A: Please like be generous and contribute something like that.
76:48 Speaker A: And then we take them.
76:50 Speaker B: Okay.
76:50 Speaker A: That process and, and then we can use that process as the, the well being projects first five and yeah, I think we'll see.
76:59 Speaker A: I'll probably.
77:00 Speaker A: I can work on that Monday maybe because I would like to see if I can get it done before your meeting.
77:09 Speaker A: We'll see if I have a chance.
77:13 Speaker B: No, and I think if we don't have that ready by the meeting, it's no problem.
77:16 Speaker B: Like they have not seen anything.
77:18 Speaker B: So this already is a lot for us to share.
77:21 Speaker B: This is good.
77:22 Speaker A: Okay.
77:23 Speaker A: Okay.
77:23 Speaker A: Well then maybe by the end of the week we'll see if I can have that survey done and then we can decide on the week after to start doing the five person onboarding.
77:31 Speaker A: What's right.
77:34 Speaker A: What happens after that?
77:36 Speaker B: Okay.
77:39 Speaker B: Should we schedule another.
77:44 Speaker B: I will stop sharing.
77:46 Speaker A: Having a, having a regular, semi regular check in would be good.
77:53 Speaker A: Like a once a week thing.
77:54 Speaker A: I think I saw somewhere like a 30 minute check in with Aaron somewhere.
77:57 Speaker A: I'm not sure.
77:58 Speaker B: Yes.
77:59 Speaker A: Yeah.
78:00 Speaker B: He will be traveling the next two weeks and I don't know if we'll be able to meet with him because other meetings have been canceled.
78:09 Speaker B: But you and I should meet.
78:10 Speaker B: I think it's a good idea to start meeting weekly.
78:13 Speaker A: Yeah.
78:17 Speaker A: Wednesdays and Fridays are good because that's.
78:22 Speaker A: I have class Monday and Tuesday and Thursday around this time or later.
78:31 Speaker A: Yeah, we can do another Friday like this.
78:34 Speaker A: It was good.
78:35 Speaker A: Closing the week, wrapping it up, you know, getting ready for that.
78:39 Speaker B: I'll be off next Friday because my brother is visiting.
78:43 Speaker B: But Wednesday, Wednesday at 4 your time or 6.
78:59 Speaker A: 4 is when the baby wakes up.
79:03 Speaker A: 6 is when we prepare dinner.
79:05 Speaker A: I was hoping to do it during nap time like now, but I could.
79:11 Speaker B: Do it right now.
79:11 Speaker B: It's 4pm for you.
79:13 Speaker B: No.
79:13 Speaker A: Yeah, especially if it's a like a half hour quick check in then four is good.
79:17 Speaker A: I'll do it at four.
79:19 Speaker A: Maybe still nothing.
79:22 Speaker B: Yes.
79:23 Speaker B: Or maybe like 3:30.
79:26 Speaker A: 3:30 is good.
79:28 Speaker B: Okay.
79:29 Speaker B: Because I have another meeting at three, but I could shorten that one.
79:32 Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
