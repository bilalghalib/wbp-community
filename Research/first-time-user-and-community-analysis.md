# First-Time User Experience & Community Ideas

**Date:** January 14, 2026  
**Purpose:** Address "what do we show people who have never entered the platform?" and identify community-building opportunities from all conversations

---

## The Core Problem

When someone logs in for the first time, we can't show:
- "47 people viewed your practitioners" (they have none)
- "Your contributions rippled through the network" (they haven't contributed)
- Stats that only exist after engagement

**But we CAN show connection to something bigger.**

---

## Ideas from the Conversations

### From Jan 9 Call with Ale

| Quote | Design Implication |
|-------|-------------------|
| "I want them to see a really awesome thing that is full of really cool content" (line 535) | The reveal should feel substantial, not empty |
| "Won't reveal survey summary until 75% complete" (line 533) | **Collective threshold** - you're part of unlocking something |
| "Feeling alone and being the first one" (line 537) | Anti-loneliness design - show you're joining others |
| "Connecting people with each other" (line 540) | Breadcrumbs to others, even without direct messaging |
| "Your contributions" section (line 600) | Personal contribution tracking matters |

### From Aaron's Call

| Quote | Design Implication |
|-------|-------------------|
| "Springboard - you come there so you can spring off" | Frame as launchpad, not destination |
| "Price of entry into the network" | Contribution = membership |
| "People that sometimes don't want people to know they're tuning in" | Respect for privacy, gentle community |
| "Build up a reservoir" | Collective resource building |

### From WhatsApp Community (WHEN Network)

| Observation | Design Implication |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Shantideva poem sharing on New Year's | Community values poetry, reflection, meaning |
| "Missing all the pretty people... love you all" | Warmth and affection is the norm |
| Spotlight sessions, newsletters, gatherings | Regular rhythm of connection |
| People sharing links to each other's work | Mutual support culture |
| "Your presence during the last spotlight session" | Showing up matters |

## First-Time User Experience Options

### Option A: "The Invitation"

Show them they're joining an existing, warm community:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                 │
│  Welcome to the Gathering                                       │
│                                                                 │
│  You're joining 847 practitioners and organizations            │
│  from 17 regions who believe in the power of                   │
│  collective wellbeing.                                          │
│                                                                 │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐       │
│  │ "May I become at all times, both now and forever    │       │
│  │  A protector of those without protection..."        │       │
│  │                        — Shantideva, shared by      │       │
│  │                          Daniel on New Year's Day   │       │
│  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘       │
│                                                                 │
│  Your first contribution helps us understand wellbeing          │
│  in your region. What you share shapes the whole.              │
│                                                                 │
│  [ Begin Your Contribution ]                                    │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why it works:**
- Shows they're joining something real (numbers)
- Cultural artifact from the community (poem)
- Personal contribution has collective meaning

### Option B: "The Map" (Visual)

Show where contributions have come from:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                 │
│  [ World Map with gentle dots for each region ]                │
│                                                                 │
│  Insights have arrived from:                                    │
│  • West & Central Africa (12 voices)                           │
│  • Latin America (34 voices)                                    │
│  • Southeast Asia (8 voices)                                    │
│  • [Your region] — waiting for you                              │
│                                                                 │
│  Each voice helps us see the whole picture.                    │
│                                                                 │
│  [ Add Your Voice ]                                             │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why it works:**
- Geographic belonging without individual stats
- "Waiting for you" - personal invitation
- Shows the collective without exposing individuals

### Option C: "The Threshold" (Collective Unlock)

From Bilal's Jan 9 idea about 75% threshold:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                 │
│  The 2026 Season                                                │
│                                                                 │
│  ████████████░░░░░░░░  67% contributed                         │
│                                                                 │
│  When we reach 75%, the Regional Insights Dashboard             │
│  unlocks for everyone. Your contribution moves us closer.       │
│                                                                 │
│  23 contributions needed to unlock                              │
│                                                                 │
│  [ Be One of the 23 ]                                           │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why it works:**
- Collective progress, not individual stats
- Clear goal with social proof
- Urgency without pressure
- "Be one of the 23" - specific, personal

### Option D: "The Gift First" (Give Before Ask)

Before asking for contribution, show what the community has already created:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                 │
│  Before you begin...                                            │
│                                                                 │
│  Here's what the community has already gathered:                │
│                                                                 │
│  📚 127 resources on burnout, trauma, and collective care       │
│  🧑‍⚕️ 89 practitioners across 14 specialties                    │
│  💬 Insights from 6 continents on what's shifting               │
│                                                                 │
│  You're about to add to this living library.                   │
│                                                                 │
│  [ Continue ]                                                   │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why it works:**
- Shows value before asking
- "Living library" - organic, growing metaphor
- Sets up reciprocity naturally

## For Returning Users (With Stats)

When we DO have engagement data, show it warmly:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                 │
│  Welcome back                                                   │
│                                                                 │
│  Since your last visit:                                        │
│                                                                 │
│  A few people found their way to practitioners you shared.      │
│  Someone in East Africa downloaded your toolkit.                │
│  The community has grown by 12 organizations.                   │
│                                                                 │
│  Ready to refresh your contribution for 2026?                  │
│                                                                 │
│  [ Update & Continue ]                                          │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key differences from Claude Code's version:**
- "A few people" not "47 people" (warmer, less gamified)
- Sentence-based, not stat-cards
- Geographic specificity adds texture
- No sparkles, emojis, or fire metaphors

## Community Features to Consider

Based on WHEN WhatsApp patterns:

### 1. **Seasonal Rhythms**
The WHEN community has monthly calls, newsletters, annual summits. Springboard could have:
- Seasonal "gathering" of insights (not continuous)
- A moment when data is "released" (like the 75% threshold)
- Annual rhythm that creates anticipation

### 2. **Shared Readings / Reflections**
The WhatsApp is full of poems, blessings, wisdom. Could include:
- A rotating "reflection" on the login page from community members
- "What sustains you?" quotes from practitioners
- Not AI-generated - actual community voices

### 3. **Regional Connection Points**
People in the WhatsApp connect around Hearth Summits (Bangalore, Ljubljana). Could:
- Show upcoming Hearth events on the platform
- "Others in your region" (without direct contact - breadcrumb approach)
- Regional insights as community knowledge

### 4. **Acknowledgment of Presence**
"Thank you for your presence during the last session" - simple, warm.
- After survey completion: "Thank you for being here. Your voice has been added."
- Not gamified rewards - simple acknowledgment

## Recommended First-Time Experience

**Combination Approach:**

1. **Welcome screen** - "The Invitation" (show community size + quote)
2. **Before survey** - "The Gift First" (show what exists)
3. **After survey** - "The Threshold" (show collective progress)
4. **On completion** - Simple thank you, not gamified celebration

---

## What NOT to Do

Based on your earlier feedback:

| Avoid | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Big stat numbers (47, 89) | "too tech bro" |
| Fire/spark/hearth overload | Can feel performative |
| Badges, points, streaks | Gamification doesn't fit the culture |
| "Add My Spark ✨" | Too cute, not serious enough |
| Heavy progress bars | Adds pressure |
| Competitive framing | This is collaborative, not competitive |

---

## Questions for Ale (Wednesday)

1. **First-time experience:** Which option resonates most with WBP culture?
2. **Community quotes:** Can we feature real quotes from community members?
3. **Regional data:** Can we show regional contribution counts publicly?
4. **Threshold unlock:** Is the 75% collective unlock idea appealing?
5. **Tone check:** Is "gathering" / "season" language right for WBP?

---

## Implementation Priority

| Feature | Effort | Impact | Phase |
|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| First-time welcome screen | Low | High | Phase 2 |
| Community stats (aggregate) | Low | Medium | Phase 2 |
| My Contributions page | Medium | High | Phase 2 |
| Threshold unlock logic | Medium | High | Phase 2 |
| Regional map visualization | High | Medium | Phase 3 |
| Community quotes rotation | Low | Medium | Phase 3 |

---

## Summary

The key insight from all conversations: **this community operates on warmth, presence, and collective meaning** - not gamification, stats, or individual achievement.

First-time users should feel:
- **Welcomed** into something that already exists
- **Meaningful** - their contribution matters to the whole
- **Safe** - they're not exposed or competitive
- **Connected** - even without direct messaging

The "magic moment" isn't about big numbers - it's about belonging.
