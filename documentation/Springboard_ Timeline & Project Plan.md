# **Springboard:** 

# **Timeline & Project Plan**

# PROJECT OVERVIEW

As The Wellbeing Project is on a mission to catalyse a culture of wellbeing in the Social Change Field, we are looking to enhance and amplify our collective impact and reach through a digital presence, with a platform and an online hub, for all of The Wellbeing Project's community of changemakers and partners.  
The main objectives of this platform will be to:  

* **Empower changemakers with reliable resources accessibility when needed:** providing tools, research and resources, credible knowledge and insights, to support them in addressing wellbeing for social change in their communities, institutions, projects and work  
* **Inspire Collaboration:** by creating a hub for connection with credible, reliable and recommended wellbeing practitioners / coaches curated by The Wellbeing Project's community and project team  
* **Drive collective action:** this will grow to be the "one stop shop" of all calls to action to contribute to the community's work and research, starting with deployment of surveys to feed into the Wellbeing Research led by the The Wellbeing Project and partners  
* **Generate collective intelligence from lived experience (NEW):** providing a Data Intelligence Hub that captures aggregated, regional insights from changemakers’ lived experience in the field. Through a once-yearly, member-only survey, users update their platform information while sharing perceptions of emerging needs, innovations, and shifts within their communities. The resulting analytics are visualized to reveal trends over time and inform strategy, research, and collective action.  
* **Strengthen connections and the network effect:** this platform will ideally in the far future, grow to be the central space to build meaningful relations, foster collaboration across member organisations and provide communities spaces to connect, share, and collaborate

Springboard is a digital platform designed to support wellbeing, learning, and sharing across The Wellbeing Project (TWP) Network. This 2026 project plan outlines the phased rollout, pilots, team responsibilities, development requirements, governance, risk management, and decision-making structures that will guide the successful launch of the platform. The goal is to move from a functional wireframe to a stable, secure, and user-ready platform that can support members from \+1,200 organization partners with high integrity, clarity, and trust.

* **Future consideration: AI-enabled insights and user support.** We will evaluate the responsible use of AI as a cross-cutting layer to the platform. Potential applications may include enhanced internal analytics and sense-making of field-level trends, as well as contextual, user-facing support to help members navigate resources and engage with the platform more effectively. Any exploration of AI will be guided by strong governance, ethical safeguards, and alignment with The Wellbeing Project’s values, trust commitments, and data principles.

# OBJECTIVES

* Pilot the platform quickly and safely using a functional wireframe   
* Uphold high privacy, security, and data-handling standards.  
* Run structured user testing with 1\) 5 internal team members, 2\) \~30 TWP network members, 3\) Scaled Soft Launch with batches of 30 new users every 2-3 weeks (TWP Community Members).  
* Align stakeholders around real user needs and community priorities.  
* Strengthen engagement, insight collection, and impact metrics.  
* Prepare TWP for long-term platform stewardship.

# DATA PRIVACY, SECURITY & CONFIDENTIALITY

[This document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q3LvunfOEwgBo5mKFywcd6ZVLa69LaeYdsxlJZFf918/edit?tab=t.0) is a starting point to guide our internal conversations about how we protect the trust of our members while building a digital platform for The Wellbeing Project Community. The intention is to define the principles, boundaries, and technical approaches that will keep everyone’s information safe, respected, and handled with care, security and integrity. 

*Key Points:*

# RISK MANAGEMENT

* Data quality issues, mitigated by early validation and cleanup during early Phases (see below).  
* Technical instability, minimized through structured testing across Phases I, II, and III.  
* UX misalignment, reduced through ongoing user testing and rapid feedback loops.  
* Design delays, prevented by involving the design team early and confirming timelines upfront.  
* Data privacy or security concerns, addressed through strong anonymization practices, legal review, and secure hosting environments.  
* Outdated or irrelevant platform information due to limited ongoing user updates, mitigated through clear communication on data ownership, targeted reminders and personal outreach, and intuitive, low-effort update flows.  
* Scope misalignment, controlled through weekly prioritization with the development team and clear decision-making.
