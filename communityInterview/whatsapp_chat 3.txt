[12/31/24, 16:29:00] ~ Daniel Plá: May I become at all times, both now and forever
A protector of those without protection
A guide for those who have lost their way
A ship for those with oceans to cross
A bridge for those with rivers to cross
A sanctuary for those in danger
A lamp for those without light
A place of refuge for those who lack shelter
And a servant to all in need
For as long as space endures,
And for as long as living beings remain,
Until then may I, too, abide
To dispel the misery of the world

[1/10/25, 15:33:55] ‪+90 533 492 81 82‬: Beannacht

On the day when
the weight deadens
on your shoulders
and you stumble,
may the clay dance
to balance you.

And when your eyes
freeze behind
the grey window
and the ghost of loss
gets into you,
may a flock of colours,
indigo, red, green
and azure blue,
come to awaken in you
a meadow of delight.

When the canvas frays
in the currach of thought
and a stain of ocean
blackens beneath you,
may there come across the waters
a path of yellow moonlight
to bring you safely home.

May the nourishment of the earth be yours,
may the clarity of light be yours,
may the fluency of the ocean be yours,
may the protection of the ancestors be yours.

And so may a slow
wind work these words
of love around you,
an invisible cloak
to mind your life.

John O’Donohue

[2/11/25, 12:39:47] ‪+385 97 669 6135‬: Dear all, I'm pleased to join the WHEN network! What a discovery, thanks to my colleague Ilke, and a warm welcome by Alejandra!

Here is a short intro: 

My name is Jagoda, I work as assistant professor at TU Delft where I teach civil engineering students about glass, facades and circularity in the built environment. The later topic in particular makes me think about the importance of educating not only technical skills but also caring attitudes, towards oneself, living beings around us and the world we inhabit. In my personal experience of higher education, as a student and now educator and researcher, I've mostly compromised my wellbeing to do my work, and then looked outside HE to heal, often through somatic work with voice and movement. Now I'd like to bring these practices together and embed wellbeing tools in engineering education. 
I look forward to sharing and learning from this community!

A quick reminder that *next Monday* (17th Feb), we have a very special *WHEN call!* I’m really looking forward to this insightful session, where we’ll dive into key questions about the future of wellbeing in higher education and explore the next steps for The Wellbeing Project and our Network.

*To help everyone prepare I’m attaching  the discussion questions* we’ll be exploring. Sharing them in advance so you can start reflecting on them beforehand: 

Where is the wellbeing movement or culture shift today? Where is the energy?
What or where are the key levers for a catalytic shift in culture? What is the “tipping point” for you?
What are you seeing that is helping with a cultural shift more broadly and in the field of social change?
What are you seeing that is challenging with the shift more broadly and in the field of social change?
Where do you see elements of convergence?
What is the unique role that The Wellbeing Project should play?
*Looking forward to our conversation! Let me know if you have any questions in the meantime*🎈💗

[3/20/25, 14:35:16] ~ pao: Dear WHEN members🫂
The Wellbeing Project is launching the Organizational Wellbeing Community of Practice  (OW CoP), a unique initiative designed to support organizations in embedding wellbeing at a systemic level. 

About the OW-CoP
The OW-CoP builds on insights from the Organizational Wellbeing Exploratory Program (OWEP), which helped eight global non-profits explore culture change through a wellbeing-focused approach. Now, we are expanding to 22 organizations, creating a space for collaboration, shared learning, and practical implementation. The OW-CoP is a 2-year long initiative and participation is free.

What Participants Will Gain
Organizations selected for the OW-CoP will benefit from:
-Online meetings with specialized coaches
-Peer learning and knowledge exchange
-Optional individual coaching sessions
-Case studies and best practice sharing
-An annual in-person retreat

Who Should Apply?
We’re looking for organizations eager to integrate wellbeing into their structures and practices. The application consists of 18 questions and takes just 5–10 minutes to complete. The OW-CoP Application Form can be found here.

*#TLDR: Sorry for late notice ... but we have some online 💻 workshops/discussions starting tomorrow through Saturday as part of LA Climate Week ... but I thought some might be relevant to the WHEN Network. Info below, feel free to share and join from wherever you are! 🙌* 

*🍁April 10 & April 12: Transformational Leadership for Climate Impact:* Bloom, the IDGs (Inner Development Goals), & the One Earth Solutions Framework Ikigai  

*🌱April 11: Accelerate the Accelerators who are Accelerating Diverse Climate Impact Efforts* 

*☘️ April 12: Founders & teams, come co-create your dream climate accelerator program* … and be careful what you wish for, it might come true! 🪄

~~

🌪️ While things might be tumultuous and stressful in the outside world, our goal is to create safe, supportive, and fun spaces for sensemaking, learning, healing, and action. 🧘 You can see info (and share?) on this *linkedin post (bit.ly/lacw2025)* , or see info below. 

🌻 By way of quick background, at Bloom we run eco/impact accelerator programs that include aspects of both personal and organizational growth, and we're getting ready to launch the Bloom software platform in stages  (bloom.pm/platform, or self-onboard at bloom.pm/start-here, beta testers and other collaborators are welcomed! 🙌 ... and workshops & cohort-based learning can be more fun! 🙂). 

*🌿See more info about these events at lu.ma/bloom* , and follow along there or bloom.pm/newsletter for more events, workshops and programs coming up at SF Climate Week & beyond. 

Any questions or ideas on any of this stuff, feel free to reach out. 🙂

I hope this message finds you well, in good health and spirits. 

One of my students, Kaddyjatou Marong, did her Honors Thesis on Trauma-Informed Care. She worked with parents and teachers. We created this mini podcast as an intervention.

How are you doing? Great to hear about your initiative on wellbeing research from the University. 
For measurement tool have you thought about using the WHO-5 Well-being Index scale? This is one of the pretty simple but robust tools to measure wellbeing in a wide range of population groups. There's ample research available that discusses it's use and efficacy
[7/5/25, 12:49:20] ~ Daniel Plá: Dear @⁨~Kamal Chowdhury⁩ , thank you! I will love to hear more about that. Could you share articles or websites where I can find more about that?
[7/5/25, 14:37:31] ~ Kamal Chowdhury: Hi Daniel, Here’s the PDF version of the scale in English, which has been translated in over 30 languages.

[7/31/25, 06:21:36] ~ Mala Kapadia: 🌊 Call to Prayer — Resonating for Safety and Peace 🌊 In light of the recent 8.8‑magnitude earthquake, one of the the most powerful in recorded history, many nations are now under watch for potential tsunami. In this moment of shared vulnerability, we invite people around the world to join in a heartfelt Ho’Oponopono prayer, resonating together as water, for protection  and safety:

Water, I’m sorry.  
Water, please forgive me.  
Water, I thank you.  
Water, I love you.

As we are all made of water, by uniting our intention in this resonance, may the waves dissipate, the tremors subside, and all beings be safe.

Dr. Masaru Emoto reminded us of the power of our shared consciousness:

“Water has a memory and carries within it our thoughts and prayers. As you yourself are water, no matter where you are, your prayers will be carried to the rest of the world.”

“By holding the intention of peace towards water, by thinking, speaking and acting with the intention of peace towards water, water can and will bring peace, to our bodies and to the world.”  

Let this intention ripple across borders and oceans, creating a global wave of consciousness focused on protection and safety to all.

[8/6/25, 13:06:59] ‪+1 (571) 277‑3826‬: So love the article:
“authentic healing demands the collective courage to hold one another accountable, to co‑imagine more beautiful possibilities and to cultivate the shared clarity and resolve needed to pursue them. Imagination can help us sketch the future we long for, clarity lights our path toward it and courage supplies our stride: Each feeds the next in a journey that carries us from injury to transcendence.” Is beautiful writing and right on target. 🎯 
Thank you.
[8/6/25, 13:44:56] ~ Mala Kapadia: Yes Ken. Totally agree. And I feel that Indigenous Knowledge Systems can help here greatly. They all have moral compass which guided their life choices. The way forward seems to be unfolding by taking a look backward and inwards.
[8/6/25, 14:45:12] ‪+1 (336) 582‑8495‬: As we discussed when we met  (almost a year ago?), the 'transformation' of the US education system is a key pillar of the current administration. Educators are seen as indoctrinating young people (with social emotional learning, DEI, decolonization, etc.) and this is creating 'woke' people who think and vote in a liberal direction. 

The administration is using legal and financial means to bring universities to heel. Columbia just capitulated, agreeing to turn over admissions and hiring records and succumb to oversight in return for the resumption of federal funding. 

The question is what do you do?

Thomas Friedman:

"...though I am a congenital optimist, for the first time I believe that if the behavior that this administration has exhibited in just its first six months continues and is amplified for its full four years, the America you know will be gone. And I don’t know how we will get it back."
[8/6/25, 16:44:46] ~ Kamal Chowdhury: Eloquently spoken and Beautifully explained❤️ @⁨Mays HEARTH Iraqi⁩ . It was insightful and resonated so well with our collective experience in our current political turmoil in Bangladesh. Many of us in the academia are currently experiencing what you mentioned “Moral Injury" in the face of persecution, forced submission to unreasonable and often very unethical demands. It touched so well. But also the resistance to it is evident and collective healing process is also there in the form of communal support and standing behind each other's back. Thank you so much once again for your excellent write up🙏🏼
[8/8/25, 01:04:44] ~ Deborah D-K: @⁨Mays HEARTH Iraqi⁩!!! Deep bow to you for writing and sharing your timely, compelling, spot on, exquisitely written IHE piece♥️ I will share this widely. I too especially love the excerpt Ken copied/pasted above…and this part: “Each act, whether public or quietly steadfast, reminds us that collective moral injury can become a springboard for systemic renewal. When we discern what truly matters, dare to envision just alternatives and summon the courage to act together, we shift from enduring harm to transcending it. In so doing, we begin to rebuild higher education on the ethical foundations that first called us to teach and learn.” YES!!!💯🙌💫 Profound thanks, Mays! 🩷

[8/12/25, 18:06:24] ‪+1 (336) 582‑8495‬: NYT: Harvard and White House Move Toward Potential Landmark Settlement

Harvard University and the Trump administration are nearing a potentially landmark legal settlement that would see Harvard agree to spend $500 million in exchange for the restoration of billions of dollars in federal research funding, according to four people familiar with the deliberations.

...In return, Harvard — one of the largest recipients in higher education of federal research money — would see its research funding restored and avoid the appointment of a monitor, a condition the school has demanded as a way to preserve its academic independence, according to two of the people.

The Trump administration would also end its widening number of investigations into the university, including ones conducted by the Justice Department and another inquiry that the Commerce Department announced on Friday. The deal would also stop attempts by the Trump administration to block Harvard from enrolling thousands of international students, according to three of the people.

...A settlement between the White House and the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university would reverberate throughout academia and could shape how other schools respond to Mr. Trump’s tactics. Last week, the administration proposed that the University of California, Los Angeles, pay more than $1 billion to reach a settlement with the government.

...Still, proponents of a possible deal have faced fierce resistance on Harvard’s campus in Cambridge, Mass.

There, faculty members and students have warned that an agreement with the White House would amount to capitulation and that Mr. Trump could not be trusted to honor any arrangement over the long term. Given those concerns, Harvard’s negotiators have pressed the administration in recent weeks, insisting that any resolution of their fight be structured as a legal settlement. A legal settlement would make it more difficult for the administration and Mr. Trump to change the terms after the fact.
[8/12/25, 19:47:35] ‪+1 (949) 212‑6186‬: Dear Colleagues,

The Arts Administrators in Higher Education (AAHE) — a professional group comprised of national arts leaders in Higher Education that lead and facilitate arts engagement within their respective institutions — has developed a brief (approximately 20-minute) online survey about the State of Arts Administration on university campuses. We would greatly appreciate your taking the time to complete the SURVEY on or before Friday, September 12, 11:59pm Pacific Time. 

If you do not work directly in the arts on your campus or feel as though the survey would be better answered by one of your colleagues, please feel free to share it with them. Also, if you have friends and colleagues at other universities who might be able to provide valuable insights, please feel free to share the link with them as well. 

Thank you in advance for your participation in the survey. We sincerely believe these aggregated findings will be beneficial for all of us as we navigate this shifting academic landscape. 

With gratitude, 
Rebecca Taylor

It's an experiment with Suno. I created a melody and added some lyrics - a prayer about emerging from the dark. I then thought of having the lyrics sung in different languages with an Indian inflection. The translations were done by ChatGPT (not sure of accuracy). The languages are Hindi, Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, Mandarin, Spanish, Swahili, and Lakota. The whole piece has an Indian sound, which is cool because so much music is delivered with an American pop expression. The video is from where we lived in Mauritius. I used to walk each morning a few feet to the shore to take in an invariably dazzling sunrise over the lagoon. #One Love

[9/2/25, 04:24:39] ‪+1 (336) 582‑8495‬: Thanks for the comment. When I was at the Center for Creative Leadership, many thought that knowledge could be easily disrupted but emotional intelligence and creativity couldn't be replicated by AI. There is ample evidence that isn't the case. 

It is helpful to think about Augmented Intelligence in addition to AI. Augmented Intelligence allows us to leverage AI rather than be replaced by it. So doctors can get alternative diagnoses and probabilities to supplement their assessment that widen their choices. Creatives can get ideas they can work with or shape outputs they direct. An elderly person can have a patient and present companion to chat with, while humans don't have the time to be with them.

A question is how do we leverage what's good and keep what isn't at bay. As we have seen with things like social media (like WhatsApp), it helps us connect easily and broadly and it can be a tool for polarization. AI is going to be a disruptive force too in education, wellbeing, and most everything.
[9/2/25, 04:26:04] ‪+1 (336) 582‑8495‬: Related to music... 

I have been playing around with AI music for a few months now and am still blown away by what's possible.  

CBS News has a couple of news features with Rick Beato about what's possible. This aligns with my experience,  though he used fairly rudimentary functions but yet created a result that surprised him with people making covers and videos of the song that was generated in minutes.

[9/17/25, 15:44:47] ~ pao: Dear WHEN! We’re sharing exciting news today 💫

The first episode of *On The Contrary* (a podcast by IDR in collaboration with The Wellbeing Project) just launched! It’s such a thoughtful conversation for anyone working to make a change 🙂

Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist Mar Cabra and Nat Kendall-Taylor share insights on:

💡 *Preventing burnout while doing meaningful work* (“we need to be well to do our jobs”)

💡 *Communicating urgent issues in ways that inspire action, not despair*

💡 *Why hope (not fear) is the most powerful tool for changemakers*

It’s full of wisdom and practical ideas for anyone caring for others while leading change. Dropping the links below. Enjoy!

[9/19/25, 19:15:15] ‪+1 (336) 582‑8495‬: Some things on my mind.

Good perspective on the role of equanimity and staying grounded. At the Leadership Forum, we have the framework of Awareness, Intention, and Action. One can think of it as related to other frameworks, such as Head, Heart, and Hands (or Think, Feel, and Act). 

Education is centrally focused on awareness and the acquisition of knowledge. Leadership development adds a focus on intention (values, purpose) as a  means to guide action or what we do with the awareness we have. These domains aren’t neatly separated, of course. Education is now a critical political target because it is seen as shaping how young people think, feel, and act. Revolutions (such as the one that toppled the government in Nepal recently) are often led by young people. What young people think is often shaped by their awareness and sense of empowerment. 

How do educational institutions acknowledge and navigate their role in a changing landscape? 
UC Berkeley (where The Greater Good is housed) just turned over the names of 160 students, faculty, and staff to Trump administration officials as part of a federal investigation into allegations of antisemitism on campus. This was a choice that fundamentally changes what happens in classrooms and on campus.  

I was talking with a colleague yesterday who is part of an organization that does youth development in 30+ countries. She was worried about what’s happening in the US will be coming to Europe. We both agreed that youth development is going to be key. Yet, unlike Europe (as of now), these programs (DEI, social emotional learning) are being removed from the realm of education in the US. The wheel is turning now (as with the piece I shared), with patriotic development being introduced by the Department of Education. 

As the landscape shifts, there are great implications for educators, students, and society. Wellbeing is connected to inner development but also shaped by tangible factors such as discrimination, poverty, hunger, and basic safety. What is the space for navigating all of this with intention and yes, equanimity? I believe that youth development (that focuses on inclusion and empathy) will increasingly have to happen outside of education. Thoughts? I know this group tries to steer clear of the political, but the political has now come for education.

[9/25/25, 17:15:24] ‪+1 (336) 582‑8495‬: I have only skimmed but the architect of Trump's attacks on education. You can hear what's driving their actions:

https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/25/opinion/trump-academia-victim-may-mailman.html?unlocked_article_code=1.ok8.wy4h.m4Cz3zphLxal&smid=url-share

Douthat: So I want to start with a big picture question. Tell me: What is wrong with the American university?

Mailman: I don’t think it’s every university, but I would say the biggest one that comes for me is a culture of victimhood — a glorification of victimhood — that is ultimately bad for Western civilization and bad for the country.

You can notice it in little pieces, like when Justice Kavanaugh was going through his confirmation hearings, the need for grievance sessions, the need for coloring books, the amount of emotional support people needed to suffer through Trump’s electoral victory. And I think that there’s this culture that universities have been perpetuating as well — maybe I call it Meghan Markle syndrome, where like the greatest good, the greatest height that you can be is a victim. So I think that’s one thing.

And then pieces of it trickle down to racism in admissions, racism in hiring. You’re hiring people to do things based on their identity rather than their ability. But I think, at the end of the day, it all boils down to a glorification of victimhood.
[9/25/25, 17:15:24] ‪+1 (336) 582‑8495‬: Connects with why empathy is seen as evil
[9/25/25, 18:53:01] ~ Mahjabeen Haque: Wish could join. I've a training session during this time. All the best to you all.
[9/25/25, 18:56:30] ~ Mahjabeen Haque: Never thought about it in this way.
[9/25/25, 19:26:58] ‪+1 (336) 582‑8495‬: It is helpful in understanding what is going on in that worldview. It is also why there is a push to cut social/support services.
[9/25/25, 19:34:26] ~ Mahjabeen Haque: Yes, grooming the nation to be selfish. No longer being human, helping the needy is no longer considered as a human quality.
[9/25/25, 19:48:20] ‪+1 (336) 582‑8495‬: Yes, but I don't think they associate it with not being human. They see it a social good. Charity may be offered by individuals but when offered by the state to some is discriminatory. Lots more that can be said about all this but it is a divide in fundamental views of life.

[11/11/25, 16:09:52] ~ pao: Hello WHEN!  Just a friendly reminder that in only one week — on November 18th — we’ll be gathering for our November WHEN Online Gathering! 

We’re excited to feature a Spotlight by Maarten Robben from Frisse Blikken (The Netherlands). Maarten will guide us through a fascinating session on Teaching, Curriculum & Pedagogical Innovation, exploring how gaming and simulation can be used in higher education (and beyond) to foster transformational learning experiences that inspire wellbeing, self-awareness, deep listening, systems thinking, and the courage to act with integrity and compassion. 🎮✨

After the Spotlight, we’ll also share our new WHEN Site, a dedicated space that gathers tools, recordings, newsletters, and resources to support our collective work and connection as a network. We can’t wait to see you there! 💛

And we are truly carbon negative. We can still spew 5 million tonnes of carbon to remain neutral. However, we have already started promoting EV cars since 2023.
