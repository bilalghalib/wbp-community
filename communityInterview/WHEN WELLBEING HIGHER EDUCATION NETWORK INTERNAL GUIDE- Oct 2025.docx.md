**Wellbeing in Higher Education Network Internal Guide for Members** 

Wellbeing Higher Education Network (WHEN) is a coalition of richly diverse, leading higher education institutions and organizations that are committed to catalyzing a culture of inner wellbeing within the social change education field. It is co-hosted and co-convened by The 

Wellbeing Project, Georgetown University, Highpoint University, and Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey. 

We believe that a flourishing life arises from the integration of wellbeing, contemplation, and social innovation, and that it occurs via engagement within ourselves, in our relationships, and with the world. When successful, it has the power to positively change individuals, communities, and societies. 

The purpose of this network is to inspire and facilitate a culture of inner wellbeing in the social change field through education of adults, graduate, and undergraduate students. Our goal is for new generations of young social change leaders to be exposed to the importance and need of wellbeing in the social change field, as well as to be equipped with some lifelong tools, sparking their curiosity to continue deepening in their personal wellbeing journey throughout their lives. 

PURPOSE STATEMENT 

The question we exist to collectively answer is, **“How do we educate the emerging generation of global leaders and changemakers in a way that centers wellbeing and flourishing for all?”** We are seeing massive increases in burn-out and mental health challenges within the field of social innovation. In response, we exist to catalyze a culture of wellbeing, both individually and systemically, within social change education. In order to actualize our purpose, we as have five objectives as a network: 

1\. Catalyze purposeful collaborations and create a global movement in social change education 

2\. Share best practices and tools for transformative learning experiences (curricular, co-curricular, and extracurricular) 

3\. Create new models and tools for the field 

4\. Do research and scholarship within the field 

5\. Raise awareness, prominence, and funding for the global movement we are co-creating. 

OBJECTIVES 

We are supporting a shift in adult/higher education programs that train people for the field of social change so that they value and incorporate inner wellbeing into the care of their programming and curricula. This journey during phase one consisted of empowering a group of ten higher education programs to incorporate and/or further develop their offerings to their students by: 

● Developing a strong, nurturing, co-learning community that models inner work and wellbeing. 

● Enabling awareness of, and access to, the science and art of wellbeing through the sharing and creating of models, tools, and case examples.  
![][image2]

● Supporting the development, implementation, and measurement of their programming interventions (across an institution, a department, a program). 

● Co-learning, sharing insights, iterating new ideas that came from initial programming. 

CRITERIA FOR POTENTIAL NEW MEMBERS 

1\. The institution has a program or a set of programs in the social change and innovation space. 

2\. There is existing support, meaning a sponsoring administrator or faculty key leader who will be engaged in the network and be the link to the program. 

3\. It is a program, college, or university focused on education for adults. Most will be programs in a graduate or undergraduate level institution, however, we are also open to higher education programs not aligned with a university. 

4\. The team joining is made up of of 2-3 members per institution (recommended) 5\. Finally, and also very important is that we're looking to support radical diversity. 

FRAMEWORK AND PROGRAM 

In the network, we intend to share knowledge and resources, spark collaborative program-building and research, and develop best practices to continue catalyzing this culture of inner wellbeing for social change leaders.
