When we have internal practices, it makes it more likely for us to find meaning in our pain. I was never a person who was actually really into social well being at all growing up. I kind of avoided it because I think I grew up in a pretty rough neighborhood. Like the neighborhood I grew up in literally had gunshot holes outside of my house. And it wasn't until after college when I started to realize that I could really make an impact in the world. The moment that I really got engaged was when Donald Trump got elected to be the United States President. I'm an author, a speaker, and a musician, and I do work to help people actually work with the invisible. So I call myself an inner activist. Because what happens with outer activism, which is very important, is that we're constantly responding to what's happening in the world. But if we don't actually transform ourselves within, then we end up recreating the same things again and again and again and again and again. So my work is really about helping people and communities and cultures transform fully within so the changes that they want to see in the world can actually last. For so many of us, we are the first generation of people to even have the opportunity to even think about things like mental health or living our purpose or, you know, living with abundance or taking care of ourselves. So many of our ancestors had to give up those things and sacrifice those things to create stability and the possibility for that generation. And we're that generation. Most people are gonna tell you meditate and do this and do that, and I love all of those things. The best practice you can do is to check yourself before you check your phone. That is the most important thing to do in the morning is to wake up and do not check your phone before you at least take a second just to check in with yourself. And that could mean just making your coffee and taking a few deep breaths. That can mean taking a shower. That can mean reading something or meditating or whatever it is that you want to do. But if we check our phones first thing in the morning, even you see your alarm ring and you look really quick, you know what happens is before you even get to start your day, you already feel that you're behind. So we cannot tie our movement for diversity to things like hope or joy or love or whatever it is. And the reason why is, is because those are emotions, and emotions change. Emotions are fleeting. You feel hope, and then you feel sad, and then you feel happy and you feel joy, and then you feel lonely, and then you feel sorrow, and then you feel this. So if we're only moving forward if we feel hope. If we're tying our movement for change to any emotion, then what happens when that emotion goes away is we lose our gas. And so we have to make our commitment to diversity, commitment to social change, to a deeper truth that goes beyond our emotions. And that's really when commitment comes into play. When you commit to something is when you don't want to do it and you do it anyways. But if we tie our commitment to something deeper, to knowing what's possible, to really committing ourselves to what's possible in the future, then even when terrible moments happen, we have even more motivation. I think that it's a myth that people who've experienced great suffering don't know how to experience joy. When you look through all communities of color and indigenous communities around the world, sometimes what suffering and grief looks like in those communities is dancing and music and singing and community and connection. And so there is a lot of joy inherent in holding the paradox of suffering and joy at the same time. And I think this is something that most communities of color around the world have actually really mastered. And so with that, I think that might be why a lot of times we see communities of color and people who have suffered trying to make an impact in the world because they know how wrong it can be. But they also, at the same time, are holding a vision for what's possible. So we hear about post traumatic stress all the time, but post traumatic growth means because of what happened to you, you bounce beyond it, you go further. You actually become more fulfilled in your purpose, in your life with meaning because of the trauma. So music is this incredible thing that has always brought people together across divides. You can go to some concerts, and people who would normally never speak to each other are sitting right next to each other singing and dancing, you know. And so this is why I use music in my work for peace building and change making. Because beyond a TED Talk or a really powerful speech, music just connects us right into the heart, pulls us together and elevates the emotion. And also to help people realize that we're not as different as we may seem. A song that is really personal to me and appropriate for this moment is a song that I wrote called I Am Enough. And I think what happens is so many of us, especially as we're trying to create change in the world, and we're doing and we're busy, we're busy, we're busy, we're busy. We forget that we are enough just for being. Just for existing. So the words Go little boy, don't. Cry you've been in pain enough little girl, don't fight you're finally safe enough? One day I'll look into your eyes show you you don't need to hide behind disguise no more spread your wings you're terrified don't be afraid you're born to fly I'm by your side I am enough I am golden baby I am enough I am enough. Are natural gifts and expressions and the things that we care about and the causes that we believe in that we can step into and make a difference in the world. And if we each just fully step into our gifts, what we have to share, we use. If you're a parent, use parenting. If you're an artist, use your art. If you're a business person, use business. But what happens is we get stuck in what we think we should do or what other people are doing or comparing ourselves, or we just don't do anything at all because we don't know how to help, right? But if we just each show up in only the corners of the world that we can reach, then we'll each be in our own places, focusing on what's really important to us, and we'll have that fire to keep going. And in this way, we will heal the world with love and compassion and care and well being for all. Sam.
