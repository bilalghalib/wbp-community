By making life easier, it allows us to experience more joy. The topic of grief and loss is something close to all of our lives and our hearts. So this topic of handling grief in a healthy way and loss and this well being Summit 2022 and this most spectacularly beautiful town of Bilbao plant seeds. And the seeds go out throughout the world and they plant other seeds. And this inspiration of handling grief and loss well, with kindness, with forgiveness, with love and compassion makes life easier. And by making life easier, it allows us to experience more joy. So we're trying to teach people and give them some of these tools so they can lead a happier life and be more successful and, and more thorough in their healing of grief. The tools fall into several categories. The first category is to remove some of our blocks to compassion. Not run away, but to recognize our negativity, our harmful attitudes and emotions. And then number two, to learn methods to transform them into their healthy opposites. Learn tools how to transform anger into tolerance and patience. Learn tools how to recognize jealousy and transform it into its healthy opposite, which is admiration or appreciation. And tools to recognize arrogance and pride and transform into human humility. So this area we call emotional hygiene. Notice we're not suppressing, we're transforming. And so we teach methods, practical methods, how to do that. The second area we teach, we talk about quite a bit is healthy self confidence. How to balance with my confidence. If I'm putting myself down, my. My self confidence is too low. If I'm putting others down, my self confidence is too high. And the third area is for people that are working with other people, right? Socially engaged in their work and their lives. And this is moving beyond empathy to compassion. Empathy is beautiful. It opens our heart, aligns us with wanting to help the other person. Empathy, we often say it's like standing in the other person's shoes. So imagine that for a moment you're pretty close if you're standing in the other person's shoes. And what happens is we become enmeshed emotionally, too close. And as a result of that, inadvertently, without trying, we take on the other person's pain. We adopt it as our own. And if we do that again and again and again, it builds up and it leads to burnout. So we make people aware, help people become aware of some of the pitfalls of empathy and that we can move beyond empathy to compassion. So emotionally we take a half step back. We're not right in the other person's shoes, so we have more perspective, we can make better decisions. Heart is still open, but we're not so enmeshed, so close emotionally that it creates problems. I think open communication is essential, that we talk to each other, that we share our work, our stories, our life passions, our life challenges as much as possible. And we get to know each other on more real level. So we learn to slowly feel that doing our best is enough. We can't do any more than that. And we celebrate that. And the things that didn't go well, you can also recognize those, but there's no, it's not necessary to beat ourselves up over those because we're human. And to be human is to make mistakes, make errors, and that's okay. And so much of it, not all of it, but much of it comes down to a state of mind. And that state of mind is being less selfish, having more concern for the welfare of others. And the more you do that, it's a win win situation. You feel better, you feel more full, you have more meaning in your life, maybe even a sense of purpose around helping others and it brings more joy and happiness to you.
