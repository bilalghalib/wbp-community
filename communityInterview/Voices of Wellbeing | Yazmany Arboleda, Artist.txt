0:00
where do we get to practice imagining
0:03
and how do we do that together
0:08
it was in the fall of 2019 that I came
0:11
to Bilbao and with Judith hemming uh the
0:14
the constellation therapist we both came
0:17
here to get to know the history of this
0:19
place and it's its narratives family by
0:22
Family person by person we would get
0:25
into circles and we would do
0:26
constellations in which we would hear
0:28
about what was hurting people what
0:30
people were having a hard time with and
0:32
he was in this process that we began
0:34
hearing from all kinds of folks that
0:35
there was heartache and that that
0:37
heartache really came from generational
0:39
Trauma from my understanding from
0:41
hearing all of these stories it really
0:43
begins with the Civil War in the 1930s
0:46
and 40s where there was so much violence
0:49
and its aftermath right when we think
0:51
about a lot of the people who were
0:53
killed all the at ETA but when I think
0:56
about that narrative I think about the
0:58
challenges of my own family back in the
1:00
mountains of many of Medellin in
1:02
Colombia in the history of racial
1:04
violence in the United States where I
1:06
now live there's generational trauma
1:08
everywhere all over the world we don't
1:10
name these things with each other we
1:12
don't name that pain we don't name those
1:14
fears we don't name that history and it
1:16
is until we can actually begin to
1:18
address and see this these things
1:20
together honor all of the people who
1:22
have passed away it is only until then
1:24
that we can actually begin to create and
1:27
collaborate on the earth and the future
1:29
that is healthy for everyone as a young
1:32
boy growing up in a Catholic Family in a
1:35
very conservative construct in Colombia
1:37
middle class
1:39
I was thought of by my own family as
1:42
being an Abomination because I was
1:44
effeminate because I spoke the way that
1:46
I spoke and when I think about feeling
1:49
like I didn't belong in my own in my own
1:51
family
1:53
I think my art practice evolved from
1:55
seeking out acceptance and celebration
1:57
of difference what I've been doing all
1:59
over the world with all of my projects
2:01
is meeting people and saying hey who are
2:03
you and this is who I am what do you
2:05
think do you accept this because I
2:07
accept that can you tell me a little bit
2:09
about how you are and where you come
2:10
from so that maybe we can get to know
2:12
each other
2:13
it's been a process of getting to know
2:16
human to Human
2:18
the beauty that exists in the world and
2:21
in that in finding that beauty
2:22
externally I've been able to find it in
2:23
myself
2:24
and so even to this moment I'm 41 years
2:27
old I'm still working towards that
2:28
self-love and that acceptance and the
2:31
well-being project and the creation of
2:32
the hospital for the soul is really a
2:35
creation for myself in one of the
2:37
constellation therapies here in Bilbao
2:39
there was a woman her name is Ane who is
2:42
from melodio a nearby town and she
2:44
literally said out loud that when she
2:46
was listening to all these stories in
2:47
her own she said gosh I think what we
2:49
need now is a hospital for the song a
2:52
place where the rain can wash away all
2:54
the blood of all of our pain
2:56
and those words really stuck with me
2:59
they sat with me and I and in thinking
3:01
about what that was I thought gosh what
3:03
is this hospital and how does it
3:04
manifest
3:05
and I understood by hearing and
3:08
listening and being in conversation with
3:10
people here that a hospital for the soul
3:12
was really a sequence of spaces in which
3:14
our encounters with nature transform us
3:16
from the constellation therapy session
3:18
to this to these moment where we have a
3:20
built space it was really critical that
3:22
we actually that I engaged with the
3:23
people from here who know the stories of
3:25
this place and who have lived in this
3:27
place and who understand it in a way
3:28
that I could never in the fall of 2021 I
3:32
had the opportunity to come to Bilbao
3:33
again and spend time with these folks
3:35
and we actually spent a week
3:37
interviewing trees
3:41
[Music]
3:43
from the mountains to the river to the
3:46
ocean I spent time drawing and touching
3:49
the bark of trunks and getting to know
3:52
the texture of leaves and I went all
3:55
over the city trying walking and
3:57
understanding the spatial dynamics of
3:58
places because what I was really
4:00
interested in creating was a temple to a
4:03
tree
4:06
foreign
4:08
[Music]
4:17
where we are sitting here today this
4:20
tree to me is beautiful and it tells a
4:24
lot of stories but it is it's a magnolia
4:26
tree in my practice I really
4:28
intentionally invite people to question
4:30
what's possible and to imagine to honor
4:34
that which they don't know about I will
4:36
tell you that most of my life I was
4:37
judged for the way that I walked for the
4:39
way that I talked and I think I so often
4:41
even to this day I judge all the time
4:43
too because it's a kind of default what
4:46
happens when we let go of those ideas of
4:48
what's right and wrong or beautiful and
4:50
ugly to be able to understand my own
4:52
suffering and to allow others to see it
4:54
I think has allowed me to connect
4:56
meaningfully with everyone I need and so
4:58
when I think people are like oh your
5:00
work is so beautiful it's so amazing I
5:02
am often like yeah but it was only
5:04
possible because I let other people come
5:05
into my life and make it with me the
5:08
invitation is that we can create
5:09
hospitals for the soul everywhere where
5:12
we're not judging each other where we're
5:14
coming in open-hearted
5:17
trying to understand better trying to
5:20
see from another perspective trying to
5:22
let go of our assumptions because often
5:24
our assumptions don't serve us a dear
5:27
friend and Mentor always says to me we
5:30
are each other's medicine we humans I
5:33
love one thing in constellation therapy
5:35
we talk about the notion that when we're
5:36
asking a question and we don't
5:38
understand we're looking for the
5:39
question inside of here and one of my
5:42
favorite things about this corner of
5:43
this hospital that's just beginning is
5:46
that the invitation is to open up and to
5:49
think gosh where dude where does the
5:51
ends what the answers could be out there
5:52
if we can only open up and see much more
5:55
about what is possible and what exists
5:57
beyond the framework that we have
6:00
individually
6:01
that's the answer it is about opening up
6:04
and allowing others to come into our
6:05
lives and to change us
6:07
[Music]
6:28
foreign
6:29
[Music]
6:36
having this particular tree reflect and
6:39
multiply and allow people to come in and
6:42
walk in and to to be inviting because
6:45
eventually what you realize is that you
6:46
see yourself and you see all of these
6:48
greens all of the variations of greens
6:51
all of the very variations of Blues in
6:53
the sky everything that is in this
6:55
construct becomes a key to open up
6:58
things in ourselves that eventually lead
7:01
to Healing
7:05
