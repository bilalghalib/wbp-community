You'll know these interviews worked if:

✅ At least 1 person says: "You're missing [X critical thing]"
✅ At least 1 person says: "Change [Y feature] to work like [Z]"

If all 5 say "looks good!" → You fucked up. They're being polite. Dig deeper.

## Draft Email to Start

**Subject**: Quick favor? Feedback on Wellbeing Project tool

**Body**:
```
Hey [Name],

I'm Bilal, working with Aaron Tanaka on a new tool for the Wellbeing Project.

I analyzed the WHEN WhatsApp chat (979 messages!) and your voice stood out.
You care about [THEIR SPECIFIC THING] that most wellbeing tools ignore.

I'm trying to talk to 5 WHEN members before building, so I don't design
in a vacuum and build the wrong thing.

Can I get 45 minutes of your time? I'll compensate however you prefer
($100 donation, direct payment, or trade).

Attached is a simple overview of what we're building and questions I have.

If you're interested, here's my Calendly: [LINK]
Or just reply with times that work for you.

No pressure if it's a no! 🙏

— Bilal
```
