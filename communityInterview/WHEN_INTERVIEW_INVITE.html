Springboard</h1>

<h1 id="hey-can-i-get-your-feedback">Hey! Can I Get Your Feedback?
🙏</h1>
<p><strong>From</strong>: Bilal <strong>To</strong>: [Your Name]
<strong>About</strong>: A new tool we’re building for the Wellbeing
Project</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="what-im-working-on">What I’m Working On</h2>
<p>Aaron (from the Wellbeing Project) asked me to design a
<strong>“springboard”</strong> tool for organizations like yours.</p>
<p>Not a social network. Not a platform where you hang out.</p>
<p>More like: <strong>You come when you need something, spring into
action, then return to close the loop.</strong></p>
<p>Think of it as a <strong>network operations center</strong> for
organizations under pressure.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="why-im-asking-you-specifically">Why I’m Asking YOU
Specifically</h2>
<p>I analyzed the WHEN WhatsApp chat (979 messages!) and your voice
stood out. You care about things that most “wellbeing tools” miss:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Political context matters</strong> (DEI bans, funding
threats, university capitulations)</li>
<li><strong>Protocols matter</strong> (Indigenous knowledge, origin
stories, relational accountability)</li>
<li><strong>Gratitude matters</strong> (closing loops, not just taking
resources)</li>
<li><strong>Youth development matters</strong> (what happens when
universities cut programs?)</li>
<li><strong>Moral injury matters</strong> (structural harm, not just
“you’re tired”)</li>
</ul>
<p>Most tools ignore this stuff. We’re trying to <strong>build FOR
it</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="what-were-building-7-core-features">What We’re Building (7 Core
Features)</h2>
<h3 id="political-environment-dashboard">1. <strong>Political
Environment Dashboard</strong></h3>
<p>See threats coming BEFORE they hit you. - Example: “DEI ban passed in
[Your Region], here’s what 5 other universities did” - Includes
<strong>adversary logic</strong> (understand their strategy, not just
react)</p>
<p><strong>Question for you</strong>: Would this actually help? What
alerts would you want to see?</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="coachtherapist-registry-context-first">2.
<strong>Coach/Therapist Registry (Context-First)</strong></h3>
<p>Not “any therapist.” More like: “Find someone who gets moral injury +
political pressure + Global South context.”</p>
<p>Recommendations include actual quotes: - <em>“Helped us name the
wound after funding cuts”</em> - <em>“Understands economic constraints
AND political repression”</em></p>
<p><strong>Question for you</strong>: What contexts matter most when
matching with a coach?</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="gratitude-loop-system">3. <strong>Gratitude Loop
System</strong></h3>
<p>You use a resource (coach, research, program) → System reminds you 2
weeks later → You thank them + share what worked → Your feedback helps
next org.</p>
<p>Prevents “take take take” extraction.</p>
<p><strong>Question for you</strong>: Does this feel helpful or
annoying? How would you want to be reminded?</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="research-repository-with-indigenous-protocols">4.
<strong>Research Repository (with Indigenous Protocols)</strong></h3>
<p>Upload research, but if it involves Indigenous knowledge: - Must tag
origin culture - Must include protocol (“Contact [Knowledge Keeper]
before adapting”) - Can’t download until you acknowledge protocol</p>
<p><strong>Question for you</strong>: Does this honor protocols
correctly? What’s missing?</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="moral-injury-assessment">5. <strong>Moral Injury
Assessment</strong></h3>
<p>NOT a burnout survey asking “Are you tired?” BUT: “Where did your org
have to compromise its ethical core to survive?”</p>
<p>Results show: You’re not broken. It’s a systemic pattern. Here are
coaches who help with that.</p>
<p><strong>Question for you</strong>: Does “moral injury” frame
resonate? What would you call it?</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="youth-development-resources">6. <strong>Youth Development
Resources</strong></h3>
<p>When universities cut DEI/SEL programs, where do youth programs
go?</p>
<p>Includes: - Training (Ubuntu Leadership Academy) - Scholarships
(Global South → Brazil) - Models (Student-led podcasts) - Alternative
spaces (Where it’s happening now)</p>
<p><strong>Question for you</strong>: What youth resources are you
looking for? What’s missing?</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="survey-tool">7. <strong>Survey Tool</strong></h3>
<p>We’d deploy a validated wellbeing survey, you get: - Your org’s
results - Comparison to sector baseline - Pre-filtered coach
recommendations</p>
<p><strong>Question for you</strong>: What do you actually need from
surveys? What’s useless?</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="what-im-not-building">What I’m NOT Building</h2>
<p>❌ Social network (no cross-org messaging, no chat) ❌ Platform you
hang out on (clear entry/exit) ❌ Payment processing (contact coaches
off-platform) ❌ Marketplace vibes (this isn’t LinkedIn)</p>
<p>It’s a <strong>springboard</strong>. You jump, you land, you return
to close the loop.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="my-questions-for-you-30-45-min-chat">My Questions for You (30-45
min chat)</h2>
<h3 id="about-your-context"><strong>About Your Context:</strong></h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>What’s the biggest threat your org is navigating right now?</li>
<li>When you need help (coach, research, resources), what’s the hardest
part of finding it?</li>
<li>Have you experienced “moral injury” (compromising your ethics to
survive)? Does that term work?</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="about-these-features"><strong>About These
Features:</strong></h3>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Political alerts: Helpful or overwhelming? What would make them
useful?</li>
<li>Gratitude loops: Would you actually close them? What’s the
barrier?</li>
<li>Protocol acknowledgment: Does blocking download feel respectful or
patronizing?</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="about-whats-missing"><strong>About What’s Missing:</strong></h3>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>What did I miss? What would make you actually USE this vs ignore
it?</li>
<li>If you could only have 3 of these 7 features, which ones?</li>
<li>What would make this feel like “coordination as care” vs “another
admin burden”?</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="how-to-help">How to Help</h2>
<p><strong>Option 1</strong>: 45-min Zoom chat (I’ll record, extract
your wisdom, validate with you) <strong>Option 2</strong>: Voice memo
answering questions (send whenever, I’ll transcribe) <strong>Option
3</strong>: Written responses (Google Doc I’ll share, fill in at your
pace)</p>
<p>I’ll compensate your time however you prefer: - Donation to org of
your choice - Direct payment - Trade (I can help with your tech
stuff!)</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h2>
<p>Aaron wants to pilot with 10-30 organizations. But if I design this
in a vacuum, I’ll build what I THINK you need, not what you ACTUALLY
need.</p>
<p>Your voice showed up 18+ times in the WHEN chat. You’re thinking
about things most tools ignore:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>pao</strong>: “No worries if you can’t make it”
(coordination as care)</li>
<li><strong>Lyndon</strong>: “Here’s what’s coming” (political
clarity)</li>
<li><strong>Mala</strong>: “Honor the protocol” (relational
accountability)</li>
<li><strong>Mays</strong>: “Name the wound” (moral injury)</li>
<li><strong>Deborah</strong>: “Close the loop” (gratitude
infrastructure)</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to build FOR you, not AT you.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>If this resonates, let me know: - <strong>Email</strong>: [Your Email
Here] - <strong>WhatsApp</strong>: [Your Number Here] -
<strong>Signal</strong>: [Your Signal Here]</p>
<p>I’m flexible on: - When we talk (your timezone, your schedule) - How
we talk (Zoom, voice memo, written) - How you’re compensated (your
choice)</p>
<p>No pressure. If it’s a no, that’s totally okay. If it’s a “not now,”
that’s cool too. If it’s a “hell yes,” let’s do this. 🙌</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="files-you-can-review-optional">Files You Can Review
(Optional)</h2>
<p>If you want to see the full design before we talk:</p>
<p>📄 <strong>SPRINGBOARD_VISUAL_SUMMARY.html</strong> - Clean overview
(open in browser) 📄 <strong>UX_WIREFRAMES_V1.md</strong> - All 7 flows
with mockups 📄 <strong>VALUES_AND_PRINCIPLES.md</strong> - How your
words shaped this</p>
<p>I can send via email/Dropbox/Google Drive.</p>
<hr />
<p>Thanks for even reading this far. 🙏</p>
<p>Your work in WHEN has been inspiring. I hope this tool can actually
support it.</p>
<p>— Bilal</p>
<p><strong>P.S.</strong> If you know someone ELSE in WHEN who should see
this, please forward! I’m trying to talk to 5 people before building, so
I don’t fuck it up. 😅</p>
