# Wellbeing Project Springboard Registry
## Values & Principles from Community

*Derived from community voices and constitutive attentional policies*

---

## Core Values

### 1. TRANSFORMATION OVER EXTRACTION
*We create conditions for mutual change, not one-way service delivery*

**What This Means:**
The registry exists to transform participants, not extract value from them. Every interaction should change both parties, not just inform one side.

**Evidence from Community:**

> "It was only possible because I let other people come into my life and make it with me. The invitation is that we can create hospitals for the soul everywhere, where we're not judging each other, where we're coming in open hearted."
> — **Yazmany Arboleda**

> "Deep inner realization about collective power is that when you come together, any oppressed group, when you come together, power goes way beyond what I can do individually."
> — **Deepa Narayan**

> "Being in Bilbao for this particular summit, I'm more excited about the fact that I'm not among a group of psychiatrists... the holisticness of their approach."
> — **Dr. Rukudzo Mwamuka**

**Why This Principle:**
Our community members consistently describe meaningful work as co-creative, not transactional. Yazmany speaks of "letting others come in and make it with me," Deepa emphasizes that collective power "goes way beyond what I can do individually," and Rukudzo values being among diverse practitioners precisely because it breaks her out of medicalized silos.

**Design Implications:**
- Resources must be annotatable/remixable by community
- Coach profiles show how they're changed by their work, not just what they provide
- Search results show network effects and connections, not isolated individuals
- Platform measures mutual transformation, not just service delivery

---

### 2. PRESENCE OVER EFFICIENCY
*We build friction and pauses that enable authentic connection*

**What This Means:**
Speed and convenience are not inherently good. The registry should slow people down when needed, creating space for real presence rather than optimizing for throughput.

**Evidence from Community:**

> "Many a times you meet someone at work, or you're walking and you say, hi, how are you? And before you even finish the sentence, you have already walked away. You don't take that moment to stop and actually listen to their response."
> — **Dr. Rukudzo Mwamuka**

> "The best practice you can do is to check yourself before you check your phone. That is the most important thing to do in the morning is to wake up and do not check your phone before you at least take a second just to check in with yourself."
> — **Justin Michael Williams**

> "Empathy is beautiful. It opens our heart, aligns us with wanting to help the other person... But what happens is we become enmeshed emotionally, too close. And as a result of that, inadvertently, without trying, we take on the other person's pain."
> — **Dr. Barry Kerzin**

**Why This Principle:**
Three practitioners independently identify the harm of rushing: Rukudzo notes we ask "how are you?" without stopping to hear the answer; Justin warns that checking our phone before checking ourselves sets us behind before the day starts; Barry describes how empathy without a "half-step back" leads to burnout.

**Design Implications:**
- Required pauses before accessing sensitive resources ("Check in: What are you feeling right now?")
- Coach matching shows "how they practice presence," not just response time
- No real-time notifications or urgent alerts
- Search includes reflection prompts, not just results
- "Slow browse" mode as default, not fast-search optimization

### 3. NAMING THE UNNAMED
*We make visible what's typically hidden - pain, power, constraints*

**What This Means:**
The registry helps surface what communities usually keep silent: generational trauma, structural constraints, hidden power dynamics, unspoken fears. Privacy protects people while they name these realities.

**Evidence from Community:**

> "We don't name these things with each other. We don't name that pain, we don't name those fears. We don't name that history. And it is until we can actually begin to address and see these things together, honor all of the people who have passed away, it is only until then that we can actually begin to create and collaborate."
> — **Yazmany Arboleda**

> "I think we have to realize that the gender story is a really important story because it's the foundation of society, it's the foundation of capitalism, it's the foundation of religion, and yet we pretend it isn't."
> — **Deepa Narayan**

> "Being a young person in your 20s, 30s, having a degree but never had a job, never worked, and being unemployed, which is one of the situations in my country in Zimbabwe, actually makes it difficult. So for those young people, they end up engaging, taking substances of abuse... but there's also the environment, the economic and social environment."
> — **Dr. Rukudzo Mwamuka**

**Why This Principle:**
All three speakers point to silenced realities: Yazmany says we must name pain/fears/history to collaborate; Deepa insists gender stories shape everything yet "we pretend" they don't exist; Rukudzo explicitly links individual mental health to structural unemployment and economic context. The unnamed cannot be transformed.

**Design Implications:**
- Profile fields that ask political questions ("What constrains you?", "What power dynamics affect your work?")
- Survey questions about structural barriers, not just individual symptoms
- Research repository tags for "generational trauma," "economic constraints," "hidden power"
- Privacy settings that protect naming without exposing to harm
- Aggregate views that reveal sector-wide patterns (not individual diagnosis)

---

### 4. TRANSFORMATION OVER SUPPRESSION
*We provide methods for changing harmful patterns, not hiding them*

**What This Means:**
The registry supports transformation of difficult emotions and patterns, not suppression or toxic positivity. Real change comes from working with negativity, not avoiding it.

**Evidence from Community:**

> "Notice we're not suppressing, we're transforming. And so we teach methods, practical methods, how to do that... Learn tools how to transform anger into tolerance and patience. Learn tools how to recognize jealousy and transform it into its healthy opposite, which is admiration or appreciation."
> — **Dr. Barry Kerzin**

> "If we don't actually transform ourselves within, then we end up recreating the same things again and again and again. So my work is really about helping people and communities and cultures transform fully within so the changes that they want to see in the world can actually last."
> — **Justin Michael Williams**

> "I go through a ritual of what am I feeling? It may be anger, it may be hurt, what is underneath that? And then take five deep breaths and that just releases the nervous system. And then another response is possible."
> — **Deepa Narayan**

**Why This Principle:**
All three describe specific practices for transformation: Barry teaches "emotional hygiene" methods to transform anger→patience, jealousy→appreciation; Justin emphasizes inner transformation so outer changes "actually last"; Deepa shares her ritual of naming feelings, breathing, then finding new responses. None suggest suppression.

**Design Implications:**
- "Methods Library" alongside practitioner profiles (e.g., "the half-step back from empathy")
- Coach profiles describe their "theory of change" - how they believe transformation happens
- Research repository includes practices, not just papers
- Survey tracks transformation capacity, not just symptom reduction
- Before/after states explicitly named (e.g., anger→patience, not just "reduced anger")

---

### 5. COMMITMENT BEYOND EMOTION
*We ground action in deeper truth, not fleeting feelings*

**What This Means:**
The registry helps people sustain commitment when hope/joy/motivation fade. Emotions are honored but not relied upon as the sole driver of action.

**Evidence from Community:**

> "We cannot tie our movement for diversity to things like hope or joy or love or whatever it is. And the reason why is, is because those are emotions, and emotions change. Emotions are fleeting... If we're only moving forward if we feel hope, then what happens when that emotion goes away is we lose our gas."
> — **Justin Michael Williams**

> "When you commit to something is when you don't want to do it and you do it anyways. But if we tie our commitment to something deeper, to knowing what's possible, to really committing ourselves to what's possible in the future, then even when terrible moments happen, we have even more motivation."
> — **Justin Michael Williams**

> "Being joyous doesn't mean you have to jump and scream. But it's the inner sense of well-being that all is well with me. And when all is well with me, I can act in a way to make all is well in the world in my own small way."
> — **Deepa Narayan**

**Why This Principle:**
Justin explicitly warns against tying commitment to emotions because "emotions are fleeting" - true commitment is "when you don't want to do it and you do it anyways." Deepa's "all is well with me" isn't about forced positivity but a steady state that enables action. Both describe sustainable practice, not emotional highs.

**Design Implications:**
- Avoid "inspirational" language or motivational framing
- Help users identify their sustainable commitment point (not excited moment)
- Track long-term patterns, not just current mood
- Coach matching includes "helps sustain commitment when emotions fade"
- Survey questions ask about practice continuity, not just current feelings

---

### 6. PARADOX HOLDING
*We honor coexistence of joy and suffering, strength and vulnerability*

**What This Means:**
The registry recognizes that opposing states coexist meaningfully. Communities can hold suffering and joy simultaneously. Individual practitioners can be powerful and afraid. This isn't contradiction - it's wholeness.

**Evidence from Community:**

> "I think that it's a myth that people who've experienced great suffering don't know how to experience joy. When you look through all communities of color and indigenous communities around the world, sometimes what suffering and grief looks like in those communities is dancing and music and singing and community and connection."
> — **Justin Michael Williams**

> "You start hiding the fact that you may be a powerful woman, but you may have still a lot of fears, or that you're a powerful man, but that you're afraid to show your weakness or what you think is a weakness."
> — **Deepa Narayan**

> "To be able to understand my own suffering and to allow others to see it, I think has allowed me to connect meaningfully with everyone I meet."
> — **Yazmany Arboleda**

**Why This Principle:**
Justin describes communities holding suffering+joy through dancing/singing; Deepa notes how power and fear coexist but we hide the fear; Yazmany says showing his suffering enables connection. None resolve the paradox - they hold it.

**Design Implications:**
- Profile fields allow both/and (not either/or): "I am powerful AND I have fears"
- Research categories for "paradox practices" (e.g., joy in grief)
- Survey questions that don't force resolution ("Are you both struggling and thriving?")
- Coach matching includes "holds paradoxes without resolving them"
- Aggregate data shows sector-wide patterns of coexistence (not just problems OR strengths)

---

### 7. COLLECTIVE POWER RECOGNITION
*We make network effects visible and celebrate interdependence*

**What This Means:**
The registry shows how individual gifts multiply when people reach their specific corners together. It reveals collective patterns and makes visible how power increases through connection.

**Evidence from Community:**

> "But if we just each show up in only the corners of the world that we can reach, then we'll each be in our own places, focusing on what's really important to us, and we'll have that fire to keep going."
> — **Justin Michael Williams**

> "I can imagine the connections that we are going to make. The people in the various spaces of well being, the people who have received similar vision of social change... everybody's going to go back to their community, everybody's going to go back to their space more enlightened."
> — **Dr. Rukudzo Mwamuka**

> "Deep inner realization about collective power is that when you come together, any oppressed group, when you come together, power goes way beyond what I can do individually."
> — **Deepa Narayan**

**Why This Principle:**
Justin describes each person reaching "only the corners of the world that we can reach" while collectively healing the world; Rukudzo envisions connections across wellbeing spaces creating enlightenment; Deepa states explicitly that collective power "goes way beyond" individual capacity.

**Design Implications:**
- "Network view" shows connections between organizations, not just individuals
- Coach profiles include "works with these organizations on these struggles"
- Research repository shows citations/influences/collaborations
- Aggregate analytics reveal sector-wide patterns ("organizations like yours also...")
- "Corners you can reach" becomes visible (unique contribution, not competition)

---

### 8. AUTHENTIC BOUNDARIES
*We protect capacity for presence through clear limits*

**What This Means:**
The registry enables healthy boundaries that protect practitioners' ability to show up authentically. Privacy isn't secrecy - it's self-protection that enables sustainable giving.

**Evidence from Community:**

> "Creating boundaries between my life and work is one of the biggest challenges because I'm quite passionate about my work... I do not work on a Saturday because I give that time to my children so that at least they do have a present mom. And their mental health is also not affected at a young age because they have an absent mother who's busy helping everybody else."
> — **Dr. Rukudzo Mwamuka**

> "The second area we teach, we talk about quite a bit is healthy self confidence. How to balance with my confidence. If I'm putting myself down, my self confidence is too low. If I'm putting others down, my self confidence is too high."
> — **Dr. Barry Kerzin**

> "I've learned that the most important thing is to let go of self-judgment, that there's nothing wrong with me, that what's, there's nothing stopping me from taking action."
> — **Deepa Narayan**

**Why This Principle:**
Rukudzo explicitly describes setting boundaries to be a "present mom" not an "absent mother helping everybody else"; Barry teaches balancing self-confidence (not too high/low); Deepa's letting go of self-judgment enables action. All three describe self-protection that serves others.

**Design Implications:**
- Granular privacy controls (who sees what, when)
- "Availability" settings that respect rhythms (e.g., "not available Saturdays")
- Profile sections that remain private for self-reflection only
- No forced visibility or "completeness" metrics
- Contact preferences that protect practitioners from extraction

### 9. HOLISTIC CONTEXT
*We honor all dimensions - spiritual, economic, cultural, relational*

**What This Means:**
The registry resists medicalization and individualization. It captures structural context, spiritual dimensions, cultural specificity, and relational dynamics - not just individual symptoms or credentials.

**Evidence from Community:**

> "One challenge that we tend to have as psychiatrists [is] medicalizing everything and forgetting that people are made up of the various components of their life. Their spiritual well being is also a very, very crucial part. And you realize that focusing on the mental health actually brings up all the other components of well being."
> — **Dr. Rukudzo Mwamuka**

> "Some of the challenges are internal. So there is stigma, there's internal stigma, there's external stigma, but there's also the environment, the economic and social environment that we are in, which sometimes poses challenges."
> — **Dr. Rukudzo Mwamuka**

> "Each one of us, no matter where we are, has a gender story. And we need to start talking and thinking about these gender stories and how they constrain us, how they shape us, right? It's a made-up story. So we can change that story."
> — **Deepa Narayan**

**Why This Principle:**
Rukudzo explicitly critiques psychiatry's tendency to medicalize while missing spiritual/economic/social components; she links individual mental health to Zimbabwe's unemployment crisis. Deepa insists gender stories (structural) shape everything. Both resist individualized frameworks.

**Design Implications:**
- Profile fields for spiritual practice, cultural context, economic realities
- Survey questions about structural barriers, not just individual symptoms
- Research categories beyond medical (e.g., "spiritual practices," "economic justice")
- Coach matching includes cultural/contextual alignment, not just modality
- Aggregate data shows sector-wide structural patterns

---

### 10. QUESTIONING "SHOULD"
*We reveal and challenge constraining narratives*

**What This Means:**
The registry helps people identify the made-up stories and "shoulds" that constrain them. It surfaces hidden norms so communities can choose different stories together.

**Evidence from Community:**

> "We should drop the word should from our vocabulary for boys and girls and whatever a child wants to do, that's what gives really confidence and brings about change and a sense of security, deep security inside that I can be who I want to be in this world."
> — **Deepa Narayan**

> "We're all locked into very narrow definitions of masculinity or femininity... It's a made-up story. So we can change that story and give ourselves greater freedoms, greater degrees of freedom to be a better human being."
> — **Deepa Narayan**

> "As a young boy growing up in a Catholic family, in a very conservative construct in Colombia, middle class, I was thought of by my own family as being an abomination because I was effeminate... And in finding that beauty externally, I've been able to find it in myself."
> — **Yazmany Arboleda**

**Why This Principle:**
Deepa wants to "drop the word should" and recognizes narrow gender definitions as "made-up stories" we can change. Yazmany describes being seen as an "abomination" for not conforming to masculine norms. Both identify constraining narratives that must be questioned to create freedom.

**Design Implications:**
- Profile prompts ask "What 'shoulds' constrain your practice?"
- Survey includes "What are you supposed to be but aren't?"
- Research repository has "narrative analysis" category
- Aggregate data reveals sector-wide constraining beliefs
- Platform design itself questions norms (e.g., "Why must profiles be 'complete'?")

## Next Steps: From Values to Affordances

Now that we have these 10 principles grounded in community voice, we can design specific features and affordances that embody them. Each principle suggests:

1. **Database schema** - what fields, relationships, access patterns
2. **UX flows** - what interactions, what friction, what visibility
3. **AI/RAG behavior** - what questions, what pauses, what connections
4. **Privacy model** - what's visible when, to whom, for what purpose
5. **Success metrics** - what we measure, what we celebrate, what we ignore
