# Springboard Registry
## UX Design for Aaron & Ale

**January 24, 2025**

---

# What We Built

Complete UX design for your pilot:
- **7 user flows** with wireframes
- **Grounded in community values** (10 interviews + 979 WhatsApp messages)
- **Honors your constraints** (not a platform, not social network)

---

# The "Springboard" in Action

## You Said:
> "It's not a platform. It's a springboard. You come there so you can spring off and do something else better."

## How We Designed It:

✅ **Clear entry/exit** - Dashboard shows launches + loops to close
✅ **No endless scroll** - Every page has action buttons
✅ **Return to refuel** - Alerts, research, gratitude reminders bring you back
✅ **NOT a hangout** - No chat, no feed, no "What's everyone thinking?"

---

# The 7 Flows

---

## Flow 1: First Login
### *Most Critical*

**What happens:**
1. Login with security reassurance: "🔒 Your data is encrypted"
2. Welcome: "This is NOT a social network. This IS a springboard."
3. Dashboard shows:
   - **Your Activity** (launches + open gratitude loops)
   - **Network Activity** (2 new alerts + new research)
   - **Quick Actions** ([Find Coach] [Browse Research])

**Design Principle:** pao's "Coordination as Care"
- "No worries if you skip this" 🫶🏼
- Warm, helpful (not corporate)

---

## Flow 2: Finding a Coach
### *Context over credentials*

**Innovation:** Recommendations WITH context
- Not "5 stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
- But actual quotes: *"Helped us name moral injury after DEI defunding"*

**Filters:**
- What are you dealing with? → `[Moral injury ▼]`
- What's your context? → `[Political pressure ▼]`
- Your region? → `[Global South ▼]`

**Coach Profile Shows:**
- Specialties (moral injury, burnout)
- Approach (liberation psychology, somatic)
- "I work well with..." (political crisis, economic constraints)
- **"Openness to change"** ✓ (Yazmany's value: "Changed by clients")

**Contact:** Email visible immediately (no booking, no chat)

---

## Flow 3: Closing Gratitude Loop
### *Energy circulation*

**How it works:**
1. You contact Coach Maria (Jan 20)
2. System tracks as "open loop"
3. Dashboard shows (Feb 3): *"You haven't thanked Maria yet"*
4. You click → write thank you + emojis 🙏💗🫶🏼 + context checkboxes
5. Maria gets email
6. Your recommendation helps next org

**Why:** Prevents "take take take" extraction (Deborah's value)

---

## Flow 4: Political Alert
### *Prepare, not panic*

**Structure** (Lyndon's framing):

### 1. What Happened
DEI ban passed in [Your Region], takes effect March 1

### 2. Adversary Logic
*"They see DEI as 'woke indoctrination.' Quote: 'Glorification of victimhood is bad for civilization.'"*

### 3. Protective Measures
What worked for 5 other universities:
- ✅ Reframed as "Student Success" (passed)
- ✅ Moved to private foundation (survives, limited access)
- ⚠️ What DIDN'T work: Quiet resistance (lost 10% funding)

**Tone:** ⚠️ informative, not 🚨 panic

---

## Flow 5: Research Upload
### *Protocol honoring mandatory*

**Key Section:**

🌊 **Does this involve Indigenous knowledge?**
- ☐ Yes, Indigenous knowledge
- ☐ Yes, traditional/ancestral practices
- ☐ No, Western/academic only

**If YES:**
- Which culture(s)? `[Maori, Lakota, Yoruba...]`
- Who to contact? `[Knowledge keeper email]`
- What acknowledgment? `[Free text]`

💡 **Why we ask:**
*"We honor origin protocols to prevent extraction and whitewashing. This protects knowledge keepers and maintains relationships."*
— Mala Kapadia

**Download:** Modal blocks until protocol acknowledged

---

## Flow 6: Moral Injury Survey
### *Structural wounds, not just symptoms*

**Key Difference** (Mays' framing):
- ❌ NOT: "Are you tired? Rate exhaustion 1-10"
- ✅ BUT: "Has your org compromised its ethical core to secure funding?"

**Results:**
```
Your Score: 6.8/10 (Moderate-High)
Sector Average: 5.2/10
Similar Orgs: 7.1/10

This is not your fault. It's a systemic pattern.
```

**Next Steps:**
- `[Search Coaches]` (pre-filtered: moral injury + political crisis)
- `[Read Research]` ("Moral Injury in Higher Ed" by Mays)
- `[View Case Studies]` (5 orgs navigated renewal)

---

## Flow 7: Youth Resources
### *Alternatives to formal education*

**Four Categories:**
- 🎓 Training (Ubuntu Leadership Academy)
- 💰 Scholarships (Brazil, Global South)
- 🤝 Models (Student trauma podcast)
- 🗺️ Spaces (Where youth dev happens now)

**Example:**
```
Ubuntu Leadership Academy
Alternative to SEL programs cut from US schools

✅ Used by 7 WHEN orgs
💬 "Helped us launch program after DEI elimination"

Contact: Lyndon Rego
```

**Lyndon's insight:** *"Youth development increasingly happens OUTSIDE education"*

---

# Values → UX

Every screen traces to community values:

| **Value** | **UX** | **From** |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Coordination as care | "No worries if you skip" 🫶🏼 | pao |
| Naming what's coming | Political alerts | Lyndon |
| Gratitude as practice | Emoji picker 🙏💗 | Deborah |
| Protocol honoring | Modal blocks download | Mala |
| Moral injury framing | "Did you compromise?" | Mays |
| Context over credentials | Political pressure filters | Multiple |
| Mutual transformation | "Openness to change" ✓ | Yazmany |

# 7 Critical Decisions

## 🔥 MUST DECIDE BEFORE BUILDING

### 1. Gratitude Loops
- **Option A:** Top of dashboard (high visibility)
- **Option B:** Middle (less pressure)
- **Recommend:** TOP (high value, prevents extraction)

### 2. Political Dashboard
- **Option A:** Core feature in pilot
- **Option B:** "Nice to have" Phase 2
- **Recommend:** CORE (hostile context is reality)
- **BUT:** Who curates? (Lyndon? Staff? Budget?)

### 3. Survey Tool
- **Option A:** TWP deploys, holds data
- **Option B:** Orgs deploy themselves
- **Recommend:** TWP-managed (fewer attack surfaces)

### 4. Security
- **Option A:** Full encryption day 1
- **Option B:** Start simple, harden later
- **Recommend:** DAY 1 (Columbia gave 160 names to feds)

---

## 🟡 CAN DECIDE AS WE BUILD

### 5. Mobile
- **Option A:** Responsive day 1 (more time)
- **Option B:** Desktop-only pilot (faster)
- **Recommend:** DESKTOP (most orgs use desktop for work)

### 6. Coach Email
- **Option A:** Show immediately
- **Option B:** Click "View Profile" first
- **Recommend:** SHOW (reduces friction)

### 7. Protocol UX
- **Option A:** Modal blocks download
- **Option B:** Inline checkbox
- **Recommend:** MODAL (Mala's requirement)

# Budget & Timeline

## What "Non-Profit Rates" Can Build

| **Phase** | **Scope** | **Hours** | **Cost** @ $75-100/hr |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Phase 1A** | 10 orgs, core features | 270 hrs | $20-27K |
| **Phase 1B** | Feedback, RAG, iterate | 100 hrs | $7-10K |
| **Phase 1C** | Scale to 30 orgs | 130 hrs | $10-13K |
| **TOTAL** | Full Phase 1 (16 weeks) | 500 hrs | **$37-50K** |

## Phase 1A Includes:
✅ Auth (org login, delegate, TWP admin)
✅ Coach registry (context matching)
✅ Political dashboard (manual curation)
✅ Gratitude system (manual Padlets)
✅ Research repo (upload, protocol, download)

## NOT Included:
- Content curation (alerts, vetting, tagging)
- Security testing (white-hat pen testing)
- Design mockups (assumes Tailwind defaults)

---

# Next Steps

## Option 1: Green Light 🚀
- Clarify budget ($25K or $50K?)
- Who curates political alerts?
- Start build next week

## Option 2: Validate First 🔍
- Show wireframes to Lyndon, Mala, Mays
- Get feedback: "Would this help?"
- Iterate UX, then build

## Option 3: Visual Mockups 🎨
- ASCII wireframes → Figma
- See what it looks like
- User test, then build

---

# What We Need From You

To move forward:

1. **Budget clarity** - $25K? $50K? Other?
2. **Political dashboard** - Core or optional? Who curates?
3. **Survey tool** - TWP-managed or org-deployed?
4. **Content plan** - Who writes alerts? Vets coaches?
5. **Timeline** - When do you need pilot? Q1? Q2?

---

# Why This Works

## 1. Values-First Process
We didn't start with "Let's build a directory."
We started with: "What do Lyndon, Mala, Mays care about?"
Features emerged FROM values.

## 2. Aaron's Constraints Honored
✅ NOT a social network
✅ NOT a platform
✅ Privacy-first
✅ Security baked in

## 3. WHEN Reality Integrated
Your pilot serves orgs navigating:
- DEI bans → Political alerts
- Moral injury → Not just burnout
- Indigenous knowledge → Protocol honoring
- Youth cuts → Alternative resources

If we built "simple coach directory," we'd miss reality.
