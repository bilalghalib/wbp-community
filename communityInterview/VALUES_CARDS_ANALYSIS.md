# Values Cards Analysis - Wellbeing Project Community Members

Analysis of community members' sources of meaning as they relate to participating in the Wellbeing Project Springboard Registry pilot.

## 1. Deepa Narayan - Liberation Through Collective Power

### Context
Deepa speaks from experience with gender violence in India and realizes education/income alone don't stop oppression. She's learned that narrow gender definitions constrain everyone, and collective action creates power beyond individual capability.

### Source of Meaning: "Unmaking Limiting Stories to Reveal Collective Capacity"

**Attention Policies:**
- **MOMENTS when people recognize they're trapped in made-up stories** about who they "should" be (as women, men, members of groups)
- **SHIFTS in possibility that emerge when someone drops self-judgment** and realizes "there's nothing wrong with me"
- **CAPACITIES that surface when oppressed groups come together** and discover power beyond individual action
- **CONVERSATIONS that name hidden fears and weaknesses** rather than performing strength or intellectualism
- **RITUALS of emotional awareness** (naming anger/hurt, five breaths, then new responses become possible)
- **PRACTICES of noticing joy** (evening reflections on small moments) that shift biochemistry toward wellbeing

### Connection to Springboard Registry
For Deepa, a registry isn't just connecting resources—it's creating infrastructure where people can challenge constraining stories together. She'd value:
- **Platform features that reveal** rather than hide human vulnerability
- **Research capabilities** that surface how gender stories shape wellbeing work
- **Community structures** where power multiplies through collective action
- **Privacy protections** that let people share fears without judgment

## 2. Justin Michael Williams - Inner Transformation for Lasting Change

### Context
Justin grew up avoiding social engagement (rough neighborhood, gunshots), got activated by Trump's election. He's an "inner activist" who believes outer activism alone recreates problems—transformation must happen within first.

### Source of Meaning: "Grounding Commitment Beyond Fleeting Emotions"

**Attention Policies:**
- **MOMENTS of checking in with myself before external demands** (don't check phone before checking self)
- **RECOGNITION of when I'm tying commitment to hope/joy** rather than deeper truth about what's possible
- **PARADOXES where communities hold suffering and joy simultaneously** (dancing/music/connection in grief)
- **GIFTS and natural expressions that I already have** (parenting, art, business) that can create change without comparing to others
- **CORNERS of the world that only I can reach** with my particular gifts and fire
- **POST-TRAUMATIC GROWTH where trauma propels me beyond** into more purpose and meaning
- **PRACTICES that transform invisible internal patterns** so outer changes actually last

### Connection to Springboard Registry
For Justin, a registry needs to support inner work alongside outer resources. He'd value:
- **Survey tools** that track both external stressors AND internal transformation capacity
- **Coach/therapist vetting** that honors people's journey of "being enough" without achieving
- **Research repository** that captures wisdom from communities holding suffering+joy paradox
- **Privacy that protects first-generation well-being seekers** exploring mental health without shame

## 3. Dr. Barry Kerzin - Moving Beyond Empathy to Sustainable Compassion

### Context
Barry teaches emotional hygiene and works with caregivers/helpers. He's learned that empathy alone (standing in another's shoes) leads to burnout—compassion requires emotional half-step back for sustainable helping.

### Source of Meaning: "Transforming Negativity Into Healthy Action Without Burnout"

**Attention Policies:**
- **BLOCKS to compassion in myself** (anger, jealousy, arrogance) that I can notice rather than run from
- **METHODS that transform harmful emotions into healthy opposites** (anger→tolerance, jealousy→appreciation, pride→humility)
- **PITFALLS of empathy where I become too emotionally enmeshed** and inadvertently adopt others' pain
- **MOMENTS of taking an emotional half-step back** while keeping heart open, gaining perspective for better decisions
- **CELEBRATIONS of doing my best as enough** without beating myself up over imperfection
- **SHIFTS toward concern for others' welfare** that paradoxically bring more joy and purpose to me

### Connection to Springboard Registry
For Barry, a registry must actively prevent helper burnout. He'd value:
- **Survey questions that distinguish empathy fatigue from healthy compassion**
- **Therapist/coach profiles highlighting emotional hygiene training**
- **Research on transformation of negative emotions** (not just suppression)
- **Privacy protections for helpers admitting vulnerability** without seeming "weak"
- **Baseline data showing** sector-wide patterns of burnout vs sustainable practice

## 4. Dr. Rukudzo Mwamuka - Authentic Presence Across Divides

### Context
Rukudzo is a psychiatrist in Zimbabwe, excited to be among non-medical wellbeing practitioners. She's learned that medicalizing everything misses spiritual/holistic components, and that authentic human connection starts with being true to yourself.

### Source of Meaning: "Stopping to Actually See the Person in Front of Me"

**Attention Policies:**
- **MOMENTS when I resist medicalizing** and instead honor all components of wellbeing (spiritual, social, economic)
- **ENCOUNTERS where I pause after asking "how are you?"** and actually wait for real response while looking at their face
- **BOUNDARIES I create between work and family** so my children have a present mother (not just helping everyone else)
- **INTERNAL STIGMA AND EXTERNAL STIGMA** in my environment (Zimbabwe unemployment, substance abuse, depression) that shape what's possible
- **CONNECTIONS across different wellbeing disciplines** that emerge when psychiatrists meet artists, activists, spiritual practitioners
- **COLLABORATIONS that form face-to-face after pandemic isolation** where real impact becomes visible in near future
- **PRESCRIPTIONS I give others** that I must also practice myself (self-care, balance, holistic care)

### Connection to Springboard Registry
For Rukudzo, a registry bridges professional silos and economic contexts. She'd value:
- **Cross-discipline connections** (medical + non-medical practitioners)
- **Research that captures non-Western, holistic approaches** to wellbeing
- **Privacy for discussing economic barriers** (unemployment, lack of opportunity) without shame
- **Survey tools that measure environmental/structural factors** alongside individual symptoms
- **Coach/therapist recommendations across cultures and economic contexts**

## 5. Yazmany Arboleda - Opening to Be Changed by Others

### Context
Yazmany grew up feeling like an "abomination" in conservative Catholic Colombia for being effeminate. His art practice evolved from seeking acceptance of difference. He creates "hospitals for the soul" where people question assumptions and imagine together.

### Source of Meaning: "Letting Go of Judgment to Discover What's Possible Together"

**Attention Policies:**
- **MOMENTS of interviewing trees/nature/places** to understand stories I could never know alone
- **ENCOUNTERS where we name pain, fears, and history together** (generational trauma, violence, heartache) rather than hiding them
- **QUESTIONS I'm holding inside** that only become answerable when I open up to others' perspectives
- **SUFFERING I allow others to see** which enables meaningful connection with everyone I meet
- **ASSUMPTIONS about right/wrong, beautiful/ugly that don't serve us** and constrain what we can imagine
- **SPATIAL DYNAMICS and textures** (bark, leaves, park locations) that reveal possibilities for healing
- **VARIATIONS and multiples** (of greens, of blues) that become keys to unlock things in ourselves
- **COLLABORATIONS where others change me** and make beautiful work possible (not my solo achievement)

### Connection to Springboard Registry
For Yazmany, a registry is a space for co-creation and transformed imagination. He'd value:
- **Platform design that resists judgment** and invites open-hearted understanding
- **Research repository as collaborative storytelling** across cultures and traumas
- **Privacy that honors naming pain without exposing people to more violence**
- **Survey questions that ask "what's possible?"** not just "what's wrong?"
- **Coach/therapist profiles showing openness to being changed** by their clients, not just "expertise"

## Cross-Cutting Themes for Wellbeing Project Springboard Registry

### Shared Attention Policies Across All Five Members:

1. **MOMENTS when vulnerability becomes strength rather than weakness** (Deepa's self-judgment release, Justin's "I am enough", Barry's celebrating doing your best, Rukudzo's prescription-to-self, Yazmany's showing suffering)

2. **PRACTICES that transform rather than suppress** difficult emotions/experiences (Deepa's breath ritual, Justin's inner activism, Barry's emotional hygiene, Rukudzo's self-care boundaries, Yazmany's letting go of assumptions)

3. **CONNECTIONS that emerge when people from different contexts meet** (Deepa's collective power, Justin's corners only you can reach, Barry's open communication, Rukudzo's cross-discipline collaboration, Yazmany's being changed by others)

4. **SYSTEMIC/STRUCTURAL awareness alongside individual healing** (Deepa's gender stories as foundation of society, Justin's first-generation opportunity, Barry's less selfishness paradox, Rukudzo's economic environment, Yazmany's generational trauma)

5. **PARADOXES where opposing things coexist meaningfully** (Deepa's joy+grief, Justin's suffering+dancing, Barry's empathy-step-back+open-heart, Rukudzo's psychiatry+spirituality, Yazmany's judgment+openness)

### Implications for Registry Design:

**Privacy Must Enable Rather Than Hide:**
- Protection creates safety to name pain/fear/vulnerability
- Not about secrecy but about preventing re-traumatization
- Allows showing weakness as path to collective strength

**Research Repository as Wisdom-Gathering:**
- Not just PDF storage but collective sense-making
- Cross-cultural, cross-discipline knowledge
- Captures how transformation actually happens (not just what's broken)

**Survey Tool as Self-Recognition:**
- Questions that help people see their own patterns
- Baseline that reveals sector-wide truth (not individual diagnosis)
- Aggregate data showing what's structurally possible vs individually "wrong"

**Coach/Therapist Registry as Match-Making for Transformation:**
- Not just credentials but attention policies and sources of meaning
- Who helps you drop self-judgment? Who holds suffering+joy paradox?
- Who bridges your context (economic, cultural, professional)?
- Who is open to being changed by you (not just fixing you)?

**Platform as Collective Power Infrastructure:**
- Features that multiply individual capacity through connection
- Tools that reveal patterns across organizations without exposing individuals
- Spaces for naming what constrains us and imagining what's possible
- Protection that enables real human connection (not performing strength)

## Key Insight for Wellbeing Project

These five people share a fundamental source of meaning: **"Transforming pain/constraint into collective possibility through vulnerable truth-telling and mutual changing."**

They're not interested in a registry that:
- Medicalizes or diagnoses
- Reinforces performing strength/expertise
- Isolates individual suffering
- Hides systemic patterns
- Extracts value from communities

They ARE interested in a registry that:
- Creates infrastructure for collective power
- Honors transformation over fixing
- Bridges silos (discipline, culture, economics)
- Protects vulnerable truth-telling
- Multiplies what's possible when people meet across difference

**The registry succeeds when it enables the attention policies above—when organizations can discover their constraining stories, transform negativity sustainably, meet authentic presence, and let go of judgment to imagine together.**
