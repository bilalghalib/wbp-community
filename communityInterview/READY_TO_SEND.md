## Draft Email to Aaron

**Subject**: Springboard UX Design Ready for Review

**Body**:
```
Hey Aaron,

I finished the UX design for the Springboard pilot. Attached is a clean
summary (or here's the HTML: [link to SPRINGBOARD_VISUAL_SUMMARY.html]).

Key highlights:
- 7 core features (coach registry, political alerts, gratitude loops, etc.)
- All grounded in WHEN community values (analyzed 979 WhatsApp messages)
- Honors your constraints (not a platform, not social network)
- Budget breakdown: $25K (Phase 1A) or $50K (full Phase 1)

Before I build, I need clarity on:
1. Budget - $25K or $50K?
2. Political dashboard - Core feature or Phase 2?
3. Survey tool - TWP-managed or org-deployed?
4. Content curation - Who writes political alerts?

Also: I want to interview 5 WHEN members to validate the design
(Lyndon, Mala, Mays, Deborah, Daniel). Can you intro me to pao
so she can connect me?

Let me know when you have 30 min to walk through this together.

## Draft Email to Lyndon (Direct)

**Subject**: Quick favor? Feedback on political alerts for Wellbeing Project

**Body**:
```
Hey Lyndon,

I'm Bilal, working with Aaron Tanaka on a new tool for the Wellbeing Project.

I analyzed the WHEN WhatsApp chat and your political analysis stood out—
you were literally doing "naming what's coming before it arrives" work
(DEI bans, Columbia capitulation, adversary logic).

I'm building a "political environment dashboard" that shows orgs:
- What happened (DEI ban in [Region])
- Why it's happening (adversary logic, not strawmanning)
- What worked (protective measures from 5 other universities)

Can I get 45 min of your time to walk through it? I want to make sure
it's actually helpful, not just more noise.

I'll compensate however you prefer: $100 donation, direct payment,
or trade (I can help with tech stuff).

Attached is a simple overview. If you're interested, reply with times
or here's my Calendly: [LINK]

No pressure if it's a no! 🙏

— Bilal
```
