# Hey! Can I Get Your Feedback? 🙏

**From**: Bilal
**To**: [Your Name]
**About**: A new tool we're building for the Wellbeing Project

---

## What I'm Working On

Aaron (from the Wellbeing Project) asked me to design a **"springboard"** tool for organizations like yours.

Not a social network. Not a platform where you hang out.

More like: **You come when you need something, spring into action, then return to close the loop.**

Think of it as a **network operations center** for organizations under pressure.

---

## Why I'm Asking YOU Specifically

I analyzed the WHEN WhatsApp chat (979 messages!) and your voice stood out. You care about things that most "wellbeing tools" miss:

- **Political context matters** (DEI bans, funding threats, university capitulations)
- **Protocols matter** (Indigenous knowledge, origin stories, relational accountability)
- **Gratitude matters** (closing loops, not just taking resources)
- **Youth development matters** (what happens when universities cut programs?)
- **Moral injury matters** (structural harm, not just "you're tired")

Most tools ignore this stuff. We're trying to **build FOR it**.

---

## What We're Building (7 Core Features)

### 1. **Political Environment Dashboard**
See threats coming BEFORE they hit you.
- Example: "DEI ban passed in [Your Region], here's what 5 other universities did"
- Includes **adversary logic** (understand their strategy, not just react)

**Question for you**: Would this actually help? What alerts would you want to see?

---

### 2. **Coach/Therapist Registry (Context-First)**
Not "any therapist." More like: "Find someone who gets moral injury + political pressure + Global South context."

Recommendations include actual quotes:
- *"Helped us name the wound after funding cuts"*
- *"Understands economic constraints AND political repression"*

**Question for you**: What contexts matter most when matching with a coach?

---

### 3. **Gratitude Loop System**
You use a resource (coach, research, program) → System reminds you 2 weeks later → You thank them + share what worked → Your feedback helps next org.

Prevents "take take take" extraction.

**Question for you**: Does this feel helpful or annoying? How would you want to be reminded?

---

### 4. **Research Repository (with Indigenous Protocols)**
Upload research, but if it involves Indigenous knowledge:
- Must tag origin culture
- Must include protocol ("Contact [Knowledge Keeper] before adapting")
- Can't download until you acknowledge protocol

**Question for you**: Does this honor protocols correctly? What's missing?

---

### 5. **Moral Injury Assessment**
NOT a burnout survey asking "Are you tired?"
BUT: "Where did your org have to compromise its ethical core to survive?"

Results show: You're not broken. It's a systemic pattern. Here are coaches who help with that.

**Question for you**: Does "moral injury" frame resonate? What would you call it?

---

### 6. **Youth Development Resources**
When universities cut DEI/SEL programs, where do youth programs go?

Includes:
- Training (Ubuntu Leadership Academy)
- Scholarships (Global South → Brazil)
- Models (Student-led podcasts)
- Alternative spaces (Where it's happening now)

**Question for you**: What youth resources are you looking for? What's missing?

---

### 7. **Survey Tool**
We'd deploy a validated wellbeing survey, you get:
- Your org's results
- Comparison to sector baseline
- Pre-filtered coach recommendations

**Question for you**: What do you actually need from surveys? What's useless?

---

## What I'm NOT Building

❌ Social network (no cross-org messaging, no chat)
❌ Platform you hang out on (clear entry/exit)
❌ Payment processing (contact coaches off-platform)
❌ Marketplace vibes (this isn't LinkedIn)

It's a **springboard**. You jump, you land, you return to close the loop.

---

## My Questions for You (30-45 min chat)

### **About Your Context:**
1. What's the biggest threat your org is navigating right now?
2. When you need help (coach, research, resources), what's the hardest part of finding it?
3. Have you experienced "moral injury" (compromising your ethics to survive)? Does that term work?

### **About These Features:**
4. Political alerts: Helpful or overwhelming? What would make them useful?
5. Gratitude loops: Would you actually close them? What's the barrier?
6. Protocol acknowledgment: Does blocking download feel respectful or patronizing?

### **About What's Missing:**
7. What did I miss? What would make you actually USE this vs ignore it?
8. If you could only have 3 of these 7 features, which ones?
9. What would make this feel like "coordination as care" vs "another admin burden"?

## How to Help

**Option 1**: 45-min Zoom chat (I'll record, extract your wisdom, validate with you)
**Option 2**: Voice memo answering questions (send whenever, I'll transcribe)
**Option 3**: Written responses (Google Doc I'll share, fill in at your pace)

I'll compensate your time however you prefer:
- Donation to org of your choice
- Direct payment
- Trade (I can help with your tech stuff!)

---

## Why This Matters

Aaron wants to pilot with 10-30 organizations. But if I design this in a vacuum, I'll build what I THINK you need, not what you ACTUALLY need.

Your voice showed up 18+ times in the WHEN chat. You're thinking about things most tools ignore:

- **pao**: "No worries if you can't make it" (coordination as care)
- **Lyndon**: "Here's what's coming" (political clarity)
- **Mala**: "Honor the protocol" (relational accountability)
- **Mays**: "Name the wound" (moral injury)
- **Deborah**: "Close the loop" (gratitude infrastructure)

I want to build FOR you, not AT you.

## Next Steps

If this resonates, let me know:
- **Email**: [Your Email Here]
- **WhatsApp**: [Your Number Here]
- **Signal**: [Your Signal Here]

I'm flexible on:
- When we talk (your timezone, your schedule)
- How we talk (Zoom, voice memo, written)
- How you're compensated (your choice)

No pressure. If it's a no, that's totally okay. If it's a "not now," that's cool too. If it's a "hell yes," let's do this. 🙌

Thanks for even reading this far. 🙏

Your work in WHEN has been inspiring. I hope this tool can actually support it.

**P.S.** If you know someone ELSE in WHEN who should see this, please forward! I'm trying to talk to 5 people before building, so I don't fuck it up. 😅
