# Ready-to-Use Interview Script
## For WHEN Wellbeing Coordinators

---

## PRE-INTERVIEW EMAIL TEMPLATE

**Subject:** Help shape the wellbeing resource registry - 60 min conversation?

Hi [Name],

I'm Bilal, working with The Wellbeing Project on a new resource registry for the WHEN network. Aaron Hurst suggested I reach out to you.

We're designing a "springboard" (not a platform!) where campus coordinators can quickly find vetted coaches, access research, and share validated tools. But before building anything, I want to understand what would actually be useful for people like you.

**This isn't a typical user interview** - I'm less interested in feature requests and more interested in understanding:
- How you currently find and vet practitioners
- What makes you trust a recommendation
- What values should guide how we design this

**The conversation will take about 60 minutes** and I'll ask you to tell me some stories about your work. I'll record it (with your permission) so I can focus on listening rather than note-taking.

Would you be available for a video call in the next two weeks? Here are some times that work for me:
- [Option 1]
- [Option 2]
- [Option 3]

Thanks for considering this,
Bilal

## INTERVIEW SCRIPT

### OPENING (5 minutes)

**[After hellos and settling in]**

Thanks so much for making time to talk with me. Let me give you some context for what I'm doing and why.

**The Project:**
The Wellbeing Project is exploring a resource registry specifically for networks like WHEN. The goal is to create something more like a springboard than a platform - you come in when you need something, get it, and leave. No social media dynamics, no ongoing engagement demands.

Think of it like: You need a trauma-informed coach for your campus, you search, you find rich information about how practitioners actually practice (not just their credentials), you contact them directly, and you're done.

We're also thinking about it for sharing research across institutions and providing validated wellbeing surveys.

**Why I'm Talking to You:**
Before we build anything, I want to understand what would actually be useful. More importantly, I want to understand what values should guide how we design this. So I'm less interested in "I wish it had feature X" and more interested in "Here's how I actually make decisions and what matters to me."

**Format:**
I'll ask you to tell me some stories from your work, and then I'll ask follow-up questions. There are no right or wrong answers - I'm genuinely curious about your experience.

**Recording:**
Is it okay if I record this conversation? It's just for my analysis - I won't share it without your explicit permission, and I'll send you a summary of what I learned once I talk to a few more people.

[Wait for permission]

Great. Any questions before we start?

### SECTION 1: STORY - SUCCESS (15 minutes)

Let's start with a story. **Tell me about a time you were looking for a practitioner or resource for your campus and found someone who was absolutely perfect.** What made them right?

**[Let them tell the story - don't interrupt]**

**Follow-up questions (adapt based on what they said):**

- How did you first find them? 
  - [If referral: What did the person who referred them tell you?]
  - [If search: Where did you search? What terms?]

- What information helped you decide they were the right fit?
  - [Probe: Was it credentials, or something else?]

- What did you notice about them - in their profile, their communication, your conversation - that really mattered?
  - [Probe for specific signals, exact words, moments]

- How did you KNOW they'd be good, not just hope?
  - [Probe: What gave you confidence? What removed doubt?]

- When you think about that person now, what made them special compared to others you've worked with?

**[If they haven't mentioned it, ask:]**
- How did they describe their practice? Not just what they do, but HOW they do it?

---

### SECTION 2: STORY - FAILURE (10 minutes)

**Now I want to hear about the opposite.** Tell me about a time you brought in a practitioner or used a resource and it didn't work out. What happened?

**[Let them tell the story - don't interrupt]**

**Follow-up questions:**

- Looking back, what were the warning signs?
  - [Probe: Were they there from the start? Or emerged later?]

- What information did you wish you'd had beforehand?

- If you were designing a profile or listing for practitioners, what would have helped you avoid that situation?

- Did you get any red flags from colleagues or your own gut? What stopped you from trusting them?

**[Key question:]**
- When someone SOUNDS right but isn't actually right, what's the gap between the language they use and the reality of how they practice?

---

### SECTION 3: CURRENT PRACTICE (10 minutes)

**Let's talk about your actual process now.** Walk me through what you do when you need to find a coach, facilitator, or resource for your campus.

**[Let them walk through it step by step]**

**Follow-up questions:**

- What sources do you go to first? Why those?

- What makes you trust one source over another?
  - [Probe: Is it the institution? The person recommending? Something else?]

- What takes the most time in your process?
  - [Probe: Searching? Vetting? Internal approval? Something else?]

- What feels risky about bringing someone new to campus?
  - [Probe: Reputational risk? Student safety? Budget? Something else?]

- Have you ever NOT acted on a recommendation even though the person came highly recommended? Why?

**[Transition question:]**
- If there was a registry tomorrow with profiles of practitioners, what would you search for first? Not just "trauma-informed" but what specific information would help you decide?

---

### SECTION 4: VALUES QUESTIONS (15 minutes)

**Now I want to dig deeper into how you actually make decisions.** These might seem like strange questions, but bear with me.

#### **On Discernment:**

**Question 1:** When you're reading about a practitioner - whether it's their website, a referral note, or a conversation - what are you actually PAYING ATTENTION TO that helps you decide?

**[Probe if vague:]**
- Is it the words they use?
- Is it their tone or presence?
- Is it specific examples they share?
- Is it how they talk about past work?
- Is it how they describe challenges or failures?

**Question 2:** How do you tell the difference between someone who's really deep in their practice versus someone who's just learned to use the right language?

**[Probe for specifics:]**
- What exact signals tip you off?
- Can you give me an example of each?
- How long does it take you to sense this difference?

#### **On Trust:**

**Question 3:** What makes a recommendation from a colleague trustworthy?

**[Probe:]**
- Does it matter what position they're in?
- Does it matter if they have a similar context to yours?
- Do you need to know HOW they found the person?
- What would make you discount even a good recommendation?

**Question 4:** When would you be willing to share your campus's wellbeing data or research with other institutions in the network?

**[Probe:]**
- What would make that feel safe?
- What would make it feel risky?
- What privacy protections would you need?
- Who would need to NOT have access?

#### **On Practice & Boundaries:**

**Question 5:** What boundaries do you have around your own time and availability when it comes to professional platforms or tools?

**[Probe:]**
- What makes something feel like it's demanding too much attention?
- Have you ever stopped using a tool because it wouldn't leave you alone?
- What notifications or updates feel helpful vs. intrusive?

**Question 6:** When you think about HOW a practitioner engages with their work - not just WHAT they do - what matters to you?

**[Probe:]**
- Does it matter if they co-create vs. deliver services?
- Does it matter if they name power dynamics?
- Does it matter if they're vulnerable about their own struggles?
- Does it matter how they describe boundaries or what they don't do?

#### **On Sustainability:**

**Question 7:** How do you tell if a practitioner will be sustainable in their work versus burn out?

**[Probe:]**
- Are there specific things they say or do that signal sustainability?
- Does it matter how they describe their own wellbeing practices?
- Does it matter if they talk about when they say no?

**Question 8:** If someone is inspiring and charismatic but emotion-dependent (only works when they're feeling hopeful), would that concern you? Why or why not?

---

### SECTION 5: DESIGN SCENARIOS (10 minutes)

**I want to show you some ideas and get your reaction.** These aren't final - they're just sketches to test assumptions.

#### **Scenario 1: Profile Information**

**Imagine a practitioner profile with these fields:**
- Name + Contact (email/website - no in-platform messaging)
- "How I Practice" (2000 characters - their own words, not a dropdown)
- "Specific Methods I Teach" (list)
- "My Boundaries" (what I don't do, what I need)
- "Traditions/Frameworks Beyond My Main Discipline"
- "How I Attend to Power Dynamics" (optional)

**Questions:**
- Would this help you discern fit?
- What's missing that you'd need?
- What's too much - what would you skip?

#### **Scenario 2: Entry Experience**

**Imagine when you log in, before showing you anything, there's a prompt:**
"Before browsing: What support are you seeking for your campus?"

**Questions:**
- Would that be helpful or annoying?
- Would it slow you down in a good way or bad way?
- What would make you skip it vs. actually answer?

#### **Scenario 3: Search Results**

**When you search, you see:**
- 5 practitioner profiles (no rankings, no ratings)
- Snippets from their "How I Practice" statements
- Tags for methods/frameworks
- Clear contact info to reach out externally

**You DON'T see:**
- How many people have contacted them
- Reviews or ratings
- "Last active" timestamps
- How popular they are

**Questions:**
- Would the absence of ratings/reviews concern you?
- How would you decide between the 5 profiles?
- Would you want fewer results? More?

#### **Scenario 4: Institutional Privacy**

**The system works like this:**
- You log in with your institutional credentials (not personal)
- Other institutions can't see who from your campus is using it
- Practitioners can see which institutions have contacted them
- No cross-institution directory of coordinators

**Questions:**
- Does this protect what needs protecting?
- What would make you nervous about institutional data?
- Who should definitely NOT have access?

---

### CLOSING (5 minutes)

This has been incredibly helpful. Just a few final questions:

1. **If this registry existed tomorrow, and you logged in for the first time, what's the very first thing you'd look for?**

2. **What would make you NOT use it?** What would make you go back to your old methods?

3. **What would make it feel extractive versus supportive?** What's the difference between a tool that serves you and a tool that uses you?

4. **Is there anything we haven't talked about that feels important?** Anything I should have asked but didn't?

**Thank you so much for your time.** This is exactly the kind of conversation I needed to have. 

**Next steps:**
- I'll send you a summary of themes I'm hearing across interviews
- Once we have a prototype, I'd love to show you and get your feedback
- If you think of anything else, please email me anytime

**One last ask:** Is there someone else in the WHEN network you think I should talk to? Someone with a different perspective or context than yours?

[Get referral if possible]

Thanks again. This was great.

## TIPS FOR CONDUCTING THE INTERVIEW

### Do:
- ✅ Let silence happen - people need time to think
- ✅ Follow their energy - dig deeper when they light up
- ✅ Ask "What else?" when you think they're done
- ✅ Probe for specifics - "Can you give me an example?"
- ✅ Mirror their language back to them
- ✅ Notice what they DON'T say

### Don't:
- ❌ Rush to fill silence
- ❌ Lead the witness ("So you'd want feature X, right?")
- ❌ Defend design ideas if they push back
- ❌ Skip stories to get to "the real questions"
- ❌ Assume you know what they mean
- ❌ Take only what confirms your assumptions

### The Most Important Thing:
**You're not trying to validate your ideas. You're trying to understand their values.**

If what they tell you contradicts your assumptions, that's the most valuable data.

## QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF AFTER EACH INTERVIEW

- What surprised me?
- What values did I hear that I wasn't expecting?
- What tensions emerged?
- What would I ask differently next time?
- What don't I understand yet?
- Whose voice am I not hearing?
