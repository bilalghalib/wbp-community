## Budget/Resource Estimate

### Transcript Extraction (One-Time)
- **5 existing transcripts × 7 HIGH priority questions** = 35 extractions
- **Cost:** ~$5.25-7.00 via your transcript tool
- **Alternative:** Manual extraction (8-10 hours)

### Interviews (8 Weeks)
- **10-12 interviews × 60 minutes** = 10-12 hours interview time
- **Transcription:** ~$1-2 per interview (or use Otter.ai free tier)
- **Analysis:** ~2 hours per interview = 20-24 hours
- **Total:** ~30-36 hours over 8 weeks

### Design/Documentation
- **VX documentation:** 16-20 hours
- **Wireframes:** 8-12 hours (depends on tool/designer)
- **Total:** ~24-32 hours

### GRAND TOTAL: ~60-80 hours over 8 weeks
**That's about 10 hours/week - doable alongside other work**

## Decision Points (What to Ask Aaron)

### 1. Timeline
- **Q:** Do we have 8 weeks or do we need to compress?
- **A:** Minimum viable = 4 weeks (skip validation phase, do afterwards)

### 2. Scope
- **Q:** Is WHEN the right pilot community?
- **A:** Or should we start with a smaller/different network?

### 3. Budget
- **Q:** Budget for transcription, contractor hours?
- **A:** This helps determine: manual vs. automated, how many interviews

### 4. Who Interviews
- **Q:** Should Bilal do all interviews or split with Aaron/Ale?
- **A:** Consistency vs. bandwidth tradeoff

### 5. Access
- **Q:** Can Aaron make intros to WHEN coordinators?
- **A:** Or does Bilal need to cold outreach?

### 6. Deliverable
- **Q:** What format does Aaron need for decision-making?
- **A:** Deck? Doc? Workshop? Demo?

## Success Criteria

**You'll know VX worked if:**

1. **Design decisions have clear rationale**
   - "We did X because it enables Y value"
   - Not "We did X because it seems good"

2. **You can defend choices to Aaron**
   - "Here's the value card that led to this"
   - "Here's the interview quote that supports it"

3. **Tensions are named, not hidden**
   - "Users want X but that conflicts with Y"
   - "Here are 3 options with tradeoffs"

4. **Scope is values-driven**
   - "This is in pilot because it's essential to core value"
   - "This is never because it violates core value"

5. **Validation confirms values enabled**
   - "Users report being able to discern depth"
   - "Users say it feels supportive not extractive"

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

### Pitfall 1: Jumping to Solutions
**Symptom:** Interviewee says "I wish it had feature X"
**Fix:** "What problem would that solve for you? Tell me about a time when..."

### Pitfall 2: Confirming Your Bias
**Symptom:** You only hear what matches your assumptions
**Fix:** Actively look for contradictions. If everyone agrees, you're not probing deep enough.

### Pitfall 3: Vague Values
**Symptom:** Values card says "trust" or "authenticity" with no specificity
**Fix:** Ask "What are you noticing that tells you this is trustworthy/authentic?"

### Pitfall 4: Feature Creep
**Symptom:** Must Do list keeps growing
**Fix:** Ruthlessly ask "Is this essential to core value or nice-to-have?"

### Pitfall 5: Ignoring Tensions
**Symptom:** Design that makes everyone happy but excels at nothing
**Fix:** Name the tension, make a choice, document why

---

## When You Get Stuck

### If Values Are Unclear
- Go back to stories
- Ask for specific examples
- Probe for feelings
- Get them to walk through their actual process

### If Design Conflicts with Values
- Don't force it
- Name the tension
- Present options with tradeoffs
- Let Aaron/team decide

### If You're Overwhelmed
- Start with just 3 interviews (Aaron + 2 coordinators)
- Focus on HIGH priority questions only
- Use existing values cards from practitioner transcripts
- Compress timeline (4 weeks not 8)

### If Aaron Pushes Back
- Show him the interview quotes
- Walk through the values → affordances logic
- Be willing to revise
- This is iterative, not final

## What Success Looks Like

**After 8 weeks, you have:**

1. ✅ Values cards for 3 personas (coordinators, users, practitioners)
2. ✅ Must Do / Mustn't Do design constraints
3. ✅ Database schema aligned with values
4. ✅ User flows that embody values
5. ✅ Validation that design enables values
6. ✅ Clear pilot scope with rationale
7. ✅ Documentation Aaron can use to make decisions

**And most importantly:**

✅ **Confidence that you're building the RIGHT thing, not just building a thing**

---

## Remember

You're not building a directory.

You're building an architecture that enables certain ways of being in relation to resources and each other.

That's what Values Experience design is about.

And that's why it matters.

## Questions? Next Steps?

1. Review this package
2. Schedule conversation with Aaron
3. Get his input on timeline, budget, scope
4. Identify first 2-3 interviewees
5. Schedule Week 1 interviews
