## Why These 7?

These extract the core information organizations need to discern practitioner fit:

1. **How they practice presence** - depth vs. surface
2. **Sustaining practice** - consistency vs. emotion-dependent  
3. **Specific methods** - concrete, evaluable techniques
4. **Surface vs. deep** - reinforces #1, quality of engagement
5. **Boundaries** - realistic expectations, prevents burnout
6. **What distinguishes them** - unique value proposition
7. **Cross-disciplinary** - holistic/integrative approaches

These map to the most important database fields:
- `how_i_practice` (questions 1, 2, 4, 6)
- `specific_methods` (question 3)
- `boundaries_statement` (question 5)
- `disciplines_and_frameworks` (question 7)

## Cost Estimate
- 7 questions × 5 transcripts = 35 extractions
- Estimated cost: ~$5.25-7.00 total (vs. $22.50-30.00 for all 15)
