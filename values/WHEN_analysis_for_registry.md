# WHEN Document Analysis - Relevant for Wellbeing Registry

## What WHEN Is

**Wellbeing in Higher Education Network (WHEN)**
- Coalition of higher education institutions committed to inner wellbeing in social change education
- Co-hosted by: The Wellbeing Project, Georgetown University, Highpoint University, Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey
- Focus: Building cultures of wellbeing within universities training social change leaders

## Key Structures Relevant to Registry

### 1. Learning Circles (Primary Community Structure)
- Small groups (6-8 members) meeting regularly
- Led by trained facilitators
- Focus on peer learning and mutual support
- **REGISTRY RELEVANCE:** These circles might need coach/facilitator resources

### 2. Wellbeing Champions/Coordinators
- On-campus leaders driving wellbeing initiatives
- Often faculty or staff who champion wellbeing
- **REGISTRY RELEVANCE:** These are the org representatives who would USE the registry

### 3. Member Institutions
Universities including:
- Georgetown University
- High Point University
- Tecnológico de Monterrey
- Plus many other higher ed institutions
- **REGISTRY RELEVANCE:** These are the "organizations" in Aaron's model

## Pain Points That Registry Could Address

### Current Challenges (Extracted from Document)
1. **Finding qualified wellbeing practitioners** for campus programs
2. **Sharing best practices** across institutions
3. **Assessing impact** of wellbeing initiatives
4. **Burnout among wellbeing champions** themselves
5. **Lack of validated surveys** for campus wellbeing assessment
6. **Siloed knowledge** - each campus reinventing the wheel

### What They're Currently Doing
- Regular convenings and summits
- Learning circles with peer support
- Resource sharing via various platforms
- Individual campus initiatives
- Research on wellbeing in higher ed

## Who to Interview for VX Process

### TIER 1: Key Network Coordinators (Start Here)
These people understand the whole system and can identify specific pain points:

**Network Leadership:**
- **Aaron Hurst** (already in your transcripts - Wellbeing Project)
- **Georgetown University representative** (co-host institution)
- **High Point University representative** (co-host institution)
- **Tec de Monterrey representative** (co-host institution)

**Why:** They understand strategic needs across multiple institutions

### TIER 2: Wellbeing Champions/Coordinators (Priority for VX)
These are the actual USERS of the registry - the org representatives:

**Roles to Interview:**
- Campus Wellbeing Coordinators
- Student Affairs Directors with wellbeing portfolios
- Faculty leading wellbeing initiatives
- Directors of Centers for Contemplative Studies/Wellbeing

**Why:** They're the ones who would actually search for coaches, deploy surveys, access research

### TIER 3: Learning Circle Facilitators
These people directly support community members:

**Why:** They understand what kinds of support resources are needed on the ground

### TIER 4: Student Leaders/Graduate Students
These are often the beneficiaries but also advocates:

**Why:** They can articulate what support they wish existed

## Specific People to Contact (If Listed in Full Document)

*[Note: Would need to extract specific names/contact info from full document - the document likely has a member directory or coordinator list]*

## Information Useful from WHEN for Registry Design

### 1. Existing Resource Gaps
- What practitioners/resources do campuses currently struggle to find?
- What types of support are most requested?
- What makes a referral trusted in this community?

### 2. Privacy/Security Concerns Specific to Higher Ed
- FERPA considerations (student privacy)
- Institutional reputation concerns
- Competitive dynamics between universities
- Power dynamics (admin vs. faculty vs. students)

### 3. Survey/Assessment Needs
- What wellbeing metrics do institutions want to track?
- What baseline data would be useful across network?
- What makes surveys actually get used vs. ignored?

### 4. Research Sharing
- What research would institutions want access to?
- How do they currently share or not share their own findings?
- What prevents open sharing of institutional data?

### 5. Community Values
- How does WHEN define wellbeing (vs. other networks)?
- What approaches do they explicitly reject?
- What power dynamics are they trying to shift?

## How This Maps to Aaron's Springboard Goals

### Use Case 1: Find Vetted Coaches/Therapists
**WHEN Context:** 
- Campuses need practitioners who understand higher ed culture
- Need coaches for faculty, staff, AND students
- Need facilitators for learning circles
- Want people who "get" social change orientation

**VX Question:** What makes a practitioner "right" for higher ed vs. corporate?

### Use Case 2: Access Shared Research
**WHEN Context:**
- Institutions doing wellbeing research but not sharing
- Need evidence to make case to administration
- Want to learn from others' successes/failures

**VX Question:** What makes research trustworthy enough to act on?

### Use Case 3: Deploy Validated Surveys
**WHEN Context:**
- Need to measure wellbeing across campus
- Want comparative data (our campus vs. network average)
- Assessment fatigue is real - surveys need to be SHORT and USEFUL

**VX Question:** What would make a survey actually get completed?

## Recommended Interview Approach for WHEN Members

### Phase 1: Network Coordinators (2-3 interviews)
**Goal:** Understand strategic landscape and identify specific user personas

**Questions:**
- What are the top 3 resource gaps WHEN members face?
- When a campus asks for a coach referral, what do you wish you could tell them?
- What makes some institutions share resources and others hoard?
- What security/privacy concerns come up around data sharing?

### Phase 2: Wellbeing Coordinators (5-7 interviews)
**Goal:** Deep dive into actual user needs and current workarounds

**Use our 15 CAP questions PLUS higher-ed specific:**
- How do you currently find practitioners for your campus?
- What's your process for vetting someone before bringing them to campus?
- What information do you wish you had before making a referral?
- What makes you trust a recommendation from another institution?
- What prevents you from sharing your campus data/research?

### Phase 3: Validation (3-5 interviews with different persona)
**Goal:** Test assumptions from Phase 1 & 2

**Show them:** Mock-ups of registry profiles, share our findings
**Ask:** Does this match your needs? What's missing?

## Key Tensions to Explore in VX Process

### 1. Individual vs. Institution
- Do people want personal accounts or institutional accounts?
- How do transitions work when coordinators leave?
- Who "owns" the institutional knowledge?

### 2. Sharing vs. Competition
- Universities compete for students/funding
- But WHEN is about collaboration
- What data feels safe to share? What doesn't?

### 3. Evidence vs. Speed
- Need for validated approaches
- But also need to act quickly with limited resources
- How to balance rigor with practicality?

### 4. Central vs. Distributed
- Some institutions have central wellbeing offices
- Others have distributed efforts across departments
- Registry needs to work for both models

### 5. Student-Facing vs. Employee-Facing
- Different needs for student wellbeing vs. staff/faculty
- Different privacy considerations
- Different assessment approaches

## Next Steps

1. **Request member directory** from WHEN coordinators
2. **Identify 2-3 coordinator contacts** for Phase 1 interviews
3. **Draft interview protocol** using CAP framework + higher-ed specifics
4. **Get Aaron's input** on which institutions to prioritize
5. **Plan timeline** - when can we interview? How many before pilot?

## Bottom Line: Why WHEN Matters for Registry

**WHEN is the perfect pilot community because:**
- ✅ They're already organized (don't need to recruit cold)
- ✅ They have identified needs (coaches, research, surveys - Aaron's 3 use cases)
- ✅ They have trust infrastructure (existing network, vetted members)
- ✅ They understand security (higher ed data privacy is serious)
- ✅ They're in Aaron's ecosystem (Wellbeing Project is co-host)

**Starting with WHEN means:**
- Real users with real needs
- Built-in feedback loop through existing convenings
- Ability to pilot at 10 institutions, scale to 30+ in network
- Aligned values (social change, inner wellbeing, collaboration)

**The VX research with WHEN will tell us:**
- What "how I practice" information actually helps coordinators decide
- What makes an institutional login work vs. break
- What privacy controls are non-negotiable
- What makes research/survey resources useful vs. ignored
- How to design for both central offices and distributed models
