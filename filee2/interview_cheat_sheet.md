## REMINDER: YOU'RE EXTRACTING CAPs

**You're looking for:**
- MOMENTS when [specific attention] reveals [meaningful insight]
- PRACTICES that feel intrinsically valuable
- WAYS OF BEING they value as ends, not means
- QUALITIES they attend to when discerning

**You're NOT looking for:**
- Feature requests
- Pain points (unless they reveal values)
- Demographic preferences
- Technical requirements

---

## PROBE PHRASES (When Answers Are Vague)

- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "What else?"
- "Tell me more about that."
- "What did that feel like?"
- "How did you know?"
- "What were you noticing in that moment?"
- "What would have been different if...?"

---

## WARNING SIGNS (You're Not Digging Deep Enough)

- ❌ They're giving you surface-level answers
- ❌ Everything is about efficiency/speed
- ❌ They're just listing features they want
- ❌ You're not hearing about feelings/values
- ❌ Stories are abstract, not concrete
- ❌ You could be talking to anyone in any field

**Fix:** Go back to stories. Ask about specific moments. Probe for feelings.
