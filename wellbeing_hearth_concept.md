# Wellbeing Project “Hearth” Directory – Concept Note (v0.1)

## 1. Context

The Wellbeing Project ecosystem brings together practitioners, educators, funders, and community weavers who care about the inner life of changemakers. Right now, a lot of connection happens through personal relationships and back-channel messages (“Do you know a good therapist?”, “Who could we bring in to hold this circle?”). 

This is warm and human—but it overburdens a few key people (like Aaron and the core team) and hides a lot of the community’s wisdom and gifts.

The “Hearth” app / directory is a gentle layer on top of the existing ecosystem. It should:
- Keep the warmth and relational quality of the network.
- Make it easier for people to find support, practices, and each other.
- Reduce repetitive requests landing on the same people.
- Create new spaces of emergence and surprise.

## 2. Beauty & Ways-of-Being This App Serves

**We’re not just building a directory. We’re tending a hearth.**  
The app should help people *practice* certain ways of being, not just complete tasks.

### For Aaron & the core Wellbeing Project team
The app helps them pay attention to:
- **Sustainable care** – the work of connecting people is shared, not resting on one or two shoulders.
- **Seeing the whole field** – being able to sense who is in the ecosystem, where they are, and what is alive for them.
- **Stewarding a movement, not a contact list** – noticing patterns, gaps, and emergent possibilities for the ecosystem.

### For community weavers, hearth holders, and group leads
The app helps them pay attention to:
- **Who is being under-seen** – people whose gifts are present but not yet called in.
- **Who needs tending** – people raising needs, questions, or vulnerabilities.
- **Where to invite reciprocity** – matching offers and needs in a way that feels relational, not transactional.

### For practitioners and community members
The app helps them pay attention to:
- **Owning their wellbeing journey** – seeing themselves as active shapers of their own care, not passive recipients.
- **Sharing what has carried them** – practices, therapists, and experiences that genuinely helped, offered as gifts to others.
- **Feeling part of a living movement** – “I’m not alone; I can see myself in a wider hearth of people with similar longings.”

### For you (Bilal) and other designers/hosts
The app helps you pay attention to:
- **Designing for unfolding, not maximizing** – not optimizing clicks or engagement, but cultivating deeper coherence and care.
- **Protecting slowness and depth** – letting some processes be intentionally unhurried (e.g., peer interviews, stories).
- **Honouring provenance** – knowing who recommended what, who interviewed whom, where trust comes from.

### What we are designing for the unfolding of

Rather than maximizing a metric, we’re designing conditions that let these things unfold over time:
- Moments of **generous sharing** (“This helped me; maybe it will help you.”).
- A felt sense of **belonging to a hearth** rather than a platform.
- **Agency in wellbeing** (“I can ask, offer, choose, and help shape this space.”).
- **Serendipitous connections** that no one could have planned in advance.
- **A culture of appreciation**, where people are seen and thanked for their invisible care work.

## 3. Core Problems / Jobs-to-be-Done

1. **“Who do you know…?” overload**  
   - JTBD: When someone in the ecosystem needs a therapist, a facilitator, or a specific kind of support, they can *self-serve from a trusted pool* rather than pinging Aaron or one of a few central people every time.

2. **Hidden gifts, invisible people**  
   - JTBD: Make it easy to see *who is here and what they bring* (skills, modalities, lived experiences, availability), so group leads and members can invite them in more often.

3. **Fragmented channels & lost messages**  
   - JTBD: Create a low-friction, searchable “memory” for the ecosystem that complements WhatsApp, Zoom, email, and in-person gatherings.

4. **Static, one-off forms that die**  
   - JTBD: Build a *living* profile/check‑in process that fits the rhythms of gatherings and community life, rather than a form someone fills once and forgets.

## 4. Experience Principles (“Hearth, not Dashboard”)

1. **Relational first, data second**  
   - People encounter conversations, stories, and faces—not just filters and fields.

2. **Invitations, not obligations**  
   - The app invites people into gentle rituals (Hearth Season, peer interviews), rather than nagging them to “complete your profile 100%”.

3. **Peer witnessing over self-marketing**  
   - Profiles can be co-written through interviews: “This is how X shows up in the world,” written by a peer.  

4. **Emergence & surprise**  
   - The system occasionally surfaces unexpected connections: “You and Asha both named ‘grief work in movements’ as alive for you this season.”

5. **Light but honest structure**  
   - Enough schema (fields, tags) to actually route needs and offers, but always paired with narrative fields and nuance.

6. **Consentful layers & safety**  
   - Clear boundaries between: public to the whole ecosystem, visible only to hearth holders, and “not for the app”.

## 5. Key Experiences & Features

### 5.1 Peer-Interviewed Profiles

- **Flow**
  - A member opts into being interviewed by a peer (or volunteers to interview others).
  - They have a light interview guide focused on stories, not just credentials.
  - The interviewer drafts or co-drafts the profile and tags it with key themes, modalities, and roles.
  - The profile shows: “Interviewed by ___ on (date).”

- **Why**
  - People often don’t see their own gifts clearly; peers can mirror them back.
  - It turns a “form” into a relational encounter.

---

### 5.2 Offers & Needs Board (Wellbeing-Focused)

- Members can list:
  - **Offers**: “I can host a grief ritual online,” “I coach leaders in burnout recovery,” “I can mentor someone starting a hearth.”
  - **Needs**: “Looking for a therapist experienced with X,” “Seeking a co-facilitator for a retreat,” “Need advice on organisational wellbeing assessments.”

- This is filterable by topic, region, language, and level of urgency.

---

### 5.3 Story & Practice Cards (Story Exchange)

- Short, structured stories:
  - “A practice that carried me during a hard season.”
  - “A moment I felt the hearth around me.”
- These become cards that can be browsed, searched, and sometimes featured in gatherings.

---

### 5.4 Gratitude / Appreciation Wall

- Simple feature where people can leave:
  - Notes of thanks to individuals (“Thank you, Lina, for your quiet support last month.”)
  - Gratitude to the wider hearth (“Grateful to be in a space where rest is honoured.”)

- Can optionally appear on profiles as “appreciation snippets”.

---

### 5.5 Global Hearth Map

- Map showing:
  - Rough location (city/region, not exact address).
  - Time zone, languages, and roles.
- Useful for:
  - Local meetups.
  - Time-zone-aware invitations.
  - Feeling the global spread of the ecosystem.

---

### 5.6 Spotlights & Learning Circles

- **Spotlights**:
  - A rotating set of profiles, stories, or practices highlighted each month/season.
  - Often tied to a peer interview.

- **Learning circles**:
  - Small themed circles (e.g., “Wellbeing of activists,” “Somatic work in organisations”) where participants update a small part of their profile as part of joining (“What is alive in your wellbeing journey right now?”).

---

### 5.7 Therapist & Practitioner Finder

- A dedicated view for:
  - Therapists.
  - Coaches.
  - Bodyworkers / somatic practitioners.
  - Spiritual/reflective companions.

- Incorporates:
  - Tags (modalities, languages, communities they’re experienced with).
  - Provenance (“Recommended by ___”, “Trusted by ___ hearth”).

---

## 6. Data We Collect (Application & Check‑In Structure)

### 6.1 Identity & Presence
- Name, pronouns (optional).
- Country/city or region.
- Time zone.
- Languages.
- How they like to be contacted (email, Signal, etc.).

### 6.2 Roles & Capacities
- Main roles in the ecosystem (practitioner, educator, funder, activist, organisational lead, artist, etc.).
- Short bio / “how I tend to show up at the hearth”.

### 6.3 Modalities & Practices
- Modalities they work with (e.g., somatics, systems constellations, contemplative practice, indigenous traditions—self-described).
- Contexts they’re most familiar with (NGOs, social movements, philanthropy, etc.).

### 6.4 Trusted Resources

- Books, practices, or communities that have been especially nourishing.

### 6.5 Offers & Gifts
- “What I can offer to this hearth in the next 6–12 months” (free, sliding scale, paid—clear but gentle framing).
- Availability constraints (seasons, time zones, energy level).

### 6.6 Needs & Questions
- Current wellbeing questions or edges (“Where I’m learning/growing right now…”).
- Types of support they might seek from the network.

### 6.7 Ways-of-Being They Want to Lean Into
Instead of “values,” a list of gentle statements they can select or add to, for example:
- “Making time to tend to others’ wellbeing in my daily work.”
- “Letting myself receive support, not only give it.”
- “Honouring the limits of my body and energy.”
- “Staying connected to joy and play, even in heavy work.”
- “Seeing myself as part of a wider movement, not alone.”

These become part of their profile and can be used for:
- Matching into circles.
- Surfacing resonant connections.

### 6.8 Participation Preferences & Consent
- Open to being interviewed? (yes/no/maybe later).
- Open to mentoring / being mentored?
- Comfortable being featured in spotlights? (yes/no/ask each time).
- Visibility preferences for different fields.

## 7. Rhythms for Keeping It Alive

1. **Annual “Hearth Season” Update**
   - Once a year (often around a major gathering), everyone is invited to *re-visit* their profile through a short, reflective prompt, not a long form.
   - Could be a communal ritual: “What has shifted in your wellbeing journey this year?”

2. **Peer Interview Weeks**
   - Designated windows where people sign up to interview or be interviewed.
   - Generates a wave of fresh, relationally-written profiles.

3. **Post-Event Micro Prompts**
   - After a retreat, hearth gathering, or learning circle, participants receive:
     - “What is one practice or resource from this gathering that you’d like to add to your profile or the shared cards?”

4. **Access-with-Gift Moments**
   - When someone requests something from the ecosystem (e.g., therapist suggestions), the app might gently ask:
     - “Before we show you the list, are you open to adding one small thing to your profile—an offer, a need, or a practice that has helped you?”
   - Not coercive, but framed as reciprocity.

5. **Quarterly Spotlights & Story Cycles**
   - Each quarter, a small set of members and practices are spotlighted.
   - The selection process becomes another moment to review profiles, update information, and invite quieter members in.

## 8. Notes & Open Design Questions

- How “finished” does a profile need to be before it’s shown? Can we normalise that profiles are always in draft?
- Who, concretely, will steward rhythms like Hearth Season or Peer Interview Weeks?
- What level of vetting is appropriate for therapists and sensitive referrals, and how is responsibility shared or bounded?
- How do we make sure people without strong internet or tech comfort can still meaningfully participate in the hearth?
- How does this app sit alongside existing channels (WhatsApp, email, in-person gatherings) without trying to replace them?

This is a starting canvas you can bring into conversation with Aaron and the Wellbeing Project team, and then refine together.
